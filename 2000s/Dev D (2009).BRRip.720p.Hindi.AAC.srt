26
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,374
What have you got?
- Stuffed breads.

27
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,082
Pickle?
- No.

28
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,290
Why?
- I forgot.

29
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,249
You want me to dip it in grass and eat it?

30
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,957
If you want to.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,457
Idiot.
- You.

32
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,749
Fool.
- You're a fool.

33
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:36,499
Eat it if you want to or dump it in the canal.

34
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,040
You're going to get whacked today.

35
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,665
You'll be walking around with a big red scars.

36
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,707
Sattu was searching for you.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,374
He was angry.

38
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:51,790
Very angry. Red with anger.

39
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:55,832
He wants to send you to London to a boarding school.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,582
As if mom will let him.

41
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:58,874
He wants to send me to London.

42
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,374
Idiotic Sattu.

43
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,665
Why are you staring at me?

44
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,332
Go, get some water.

45
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,874
Get it yourself.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,540
Are you getting it or should I whack you?

47
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:12,290
What will you do?
- I'll bite you.

48
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,832
I'll scratch you.

49
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,124
I swear, Sattu.
I didn't smoke.

50
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,915
Why are you hitting me?

51
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:38,999
I'm your Father, not Sattu.

52
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:43,749
But grandma calls you Sattu.
- She's my mother.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,707
But even my mother calls you Sattu.
Sattu.

54
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,915
Why are you hitting me?

55
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,124
Don't look at me.

56
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,832
Was your teacher lying when he told me you smoked?

57
00:03:57,166 --> 00:04:00,374
Make up your mind about why you're hitting me..

58
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:04,999
..for smoking or for calling you Sattu?

59
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:06,999
Keep quiet.

60
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,832
He's going abroad, Kaushalya.
That's final.

61
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,040
He'll die without us.

62
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,707
He'll bring us shame if he stays here.

63
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,707
Unmannerly.
Calls his own dad by his name.

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,124
What do I do?

65
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,874
When I call you 'my own dad' Kaushalya glares at me.

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,624
Shut up.

67
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:31,332
Pack his bags, he's leaving tomorrow.

68
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,165
Tomorrow?

69
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,124
Be grateful that I've given mother and son one night..

70
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,749
..to do all your emotional 'give and takes.'

71
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,249
Sattu's gone mad.
- Shut up.

72
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:45,665
Sattu.
- Insane.

73
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,832
I'm growing bigger day-by-day.

74
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:10,957
How big?

75
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,457
Big enough for you.

76
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:23,165
Mummy says, get marry or else, someone will take me away.

77
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:26,332
You don't agree.

78
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:31,790
I was about to say that I won't allow
anyone to touch me before Dev.

79
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,957
Paro, I am going insane.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,582
I'm losing it too.

81
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,624
Come back soon.

82
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,040
You're losing it?
I've lost it.

83
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:52,915
Yes, I've lost it too.

84
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,957
You just said you were losing it.

85
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:59,915
Yes, I was, now I have lost it totally.

86
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:06,874
Paro.

87
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:11,874
Do you..

88
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,957
Do you touch yourself?

89
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,540
Tell me.

90
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:32,749
Paro.

91
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,207
Send me your photograph.

92
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:38,749
You have it.

93
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,290
A naked one.

94
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:45,874
Have you completely lost it?

95
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:27,749
If you ever tell me again to do such a..

96
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,124
..crazy thing I'll kill you.

97
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,957
You know how difficult it was?

98
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,290
I had to go 17th Sector, Chandigarh to send them.

99
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:37,332
My heart was pounding like an engine.

100
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,582
As if they all knew what's in my bag.

101
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:42,749
And that photo shop guy was staring at me..

102
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,249
..like he has never seen them before.

103
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:46,457
Like his wife applies pimple-removers.

104
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,124
Rogue.

105
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,708
Tell me how to use the scanner.

106
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:50,499
I'll do it myself.

107
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,749
Madam, why do you take the trouble when I'm here?

108
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:55,915
I'll bring the photo so alive that
people would want to touch it..

109
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,790
Don't you get it, fatso?

110
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,915
Paro, I'm coming back.

111
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:45,124
"Come away now.."

112
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,082
"You cast your spell and went away."

113
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,374
"Left me wanting more each day."

114
00:08:56,458 --> 00:09:00,790
"The rhythm's taking over."

115
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:03,040
"A longing's bloomed inside my heart."

116
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,290
"Like a bird chirrups in zest."

117
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:09,707
"The rhythm's taking over."

118
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:13,874
"I swing, I sigh, with a heady high."

119
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,327
"Give me your hand now.

120
00:09:16,328 --> 00:09:18,540
Give me your hand now."

121
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:23,415
"I think I'll fly and touch the sky.."

122
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,957
Yes, he's come. Here.

123
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:53,624
Throw this in the dustbin.

124
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,040
Son, it's your brother Dwij's 'Haldi' (pre-marriage ritual) today.

125
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,124
"The rhythm's taking over."

126
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:23,457
"A longing's bloomed inside my heart."

127
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,665
"Like a bird chirps in zest."

128
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:32,832
"The rhythm's taking over."

129
00:10:56,208 --> 00:11:01,374
"Oh my beloved..."

130
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:05,707
"I'm coloured in your hues.."

131
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,082
"..bathed in desire, I'm your muse.."

132
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,665
"Our joys stacked up will make a hill.."

133
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,915
"..on it we'll sit, you and I.."

134
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,165
"..and rejoice."

135
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:23,040
"Madness will your love evoke."

136
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:27,957
"You'll wrap around me like a cloak."

137
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,290
I'll surrender myself towards you.

138
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,999
"With you it all feels so right."

139
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,020
"With you it all feels so right.

140
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:38,957
With you it all feels so right."

141
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,249
"You cast your spell and went away."

142
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,457
"Left me wanting more each day."

143
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:47,915
"The rhythm's taking over."

144
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,124
"A longing's bloomed inside my heart."

145
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:52,374
"Like a bird chirps in zest."

146
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:57,165
"The rhythm's taking over."

147
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:01,124
"I swing, I sigh with a heady high."

148
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:06,082
"Give me your hand now."

149
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:09,874
"I think I'll fly and touch the sky."

150
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:13,874
"Come with me now."

151
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,082
"My anklet shivers to the beat."

152
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,332
"My bindi (adornment) shimmers in its forehead seat."

153
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,874
"We're all drowning in the lake of love."

154
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,999
"My anklet shivers to the beat."

155
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:27,207
"My bindi shimmers in its forehead seat."

156
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:30,874
"We're all drowning in the lake of love."

157
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,915
"My anklet shivers to the beat."

158
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,165
"My bindi shimmers in its forehead seat."

159
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,915
"We're all drowning in the lake of love."

160
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,999
"My love."

161
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,790
"My love.."

162
00:12:58,708 --> 00:12:59,874
What happened?

163
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,374
Dev, how are you?

164
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:09,665
Manager uncle.

165
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,874
Top form.

166
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,249
Haven't seen you since ages.

167
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:17,374
Son, what's that on your shirt?

168
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,124
I don't know.

169
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,082
It looks like Turmeric (haldi).

170
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,499
It smells like turmeric.

171
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,290
It is `turmeric.'
- Yes.

172
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:43,332
Paro.

173
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,165
What are you searching for on the floor?

174
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,457
Well.. my earrings.

175
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:55,374
What's on your ears then?
- On my ears?

176
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,832
Well.. earrings.

177
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:04,040
Paro, come out.
- Yes.

178
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:07,415
What's on your hands?

179
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,415
It looks like turmeric.

180
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,582
It smells like turmeric.

181
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,999
It is turmeric.

182
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:26,165
Paro, go out.

183
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,124
Welcome, sir.
I'm Sunil.

184
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,540
Come along.

185
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,207
Please come.

186
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,249
Sir, the sugarcane juice crystallises and comes here.

187
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:15,124
And this is where we check if it has turned into sugar.

188
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:17,999
Hello, son.

189
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,165
First time?

190
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,165
No.

191
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,499
You can't put your hands in.
- Why not?

192
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,915
My dress is too tight.
- Shall I rip it?

193
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,415
So that I go around without clothes?

194
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,332
Let go of my hands.
- I won't.

195
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:18,540
I am a Jatni (caste).
- Even I am a Jat.

196
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:24,165
I love you.

197
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,374
Paro.

198
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:36,624
Paro.
- Yes. I'm coming.

199
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,203
What are you doing there?

200
00:16:38,204 --> 00:16:39,165
- Don't come here.

201
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,582
I'm coming.

202
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,290
Your father will surely die one day.

203
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:50,699
What were you doing there?

204
00:16:50,763 --> 00:16:52,054
There's a long queue outside the toilet.

205
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:53,874
What?

206
00:17:05,763 --> 00:17:08,345
So that the dogs don't come and eat the food.

207
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,540
Paro. Paro.

208
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:18,207
Open the door..

209
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,915
There's a long queue outside the toilet.

210
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,457
Hey, you.
- Paro.

211
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,457
Do something.

212
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:40,582
What do I do?
- Find a solution.

213
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,207
So desperate?

214
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,082
Yes.

215
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:47,249
That's good.

216
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,457
Paro..

217
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:51,832
Hello.

218
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:53,582
Hi.

219
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,915
I'm Rasika.

220
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,749
I'm Dev.

221
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:02,082
I know that you've studied in London.

222
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,790
Even I'm going there.
Oxford.

223
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,582
Are you?
- Yes. - Very impressive.

224
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:09,207
I'm from Delhi.
- I'm from here.

225
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:15,957
Aunt Kaushalya wants us to get something from the farm.

226
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:20,624
Is it?
- Yes. Shall we?

227
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,165
Come on.

228
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:29,415
I was so bored there.

229
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,957
Do you have a girlfriend?

230
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:35,999
Yes.

231
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,332
Have you guys done it?

232
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,874
Done what?

233
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,249
S. E. X.

234
00:18:51,083 --> 00:18:52,999
Listen.
- What?

235
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,165
I'll be back.
- Okay.

236
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,415
Tell me.

237
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,874
I need the keys to your room.

238
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,165
Why?
- My Dev is back.

239
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:16,999
So, why should I give you my room keys?

240
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:18,832
Give it to me.

241
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,374
I love you.

242
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:24,165
If you want to do it with Dev,
why don't you do it in his room?

243
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,514
Why don't you get it?

244
00:19:28,515 --> 00:19:29,665
Heavy crowd is here.

245
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,999
It's a wedding.

246
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,290
Have I ever said no to you?

247
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,040
I love you.

248
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,665
Look at your status.
Loves me.

249
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,749
Be grateful that..
Get lost.

250
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,082
Aunt, you've given the servants a free hand here.

251
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,749
Look at him.
- What happened?

252
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,707
What happened?

253
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,415
Look..

254
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:58,499
Listen, Paro is the most sensuous girl in this village.

255
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,790
You're right.
- She can break the bed.

256
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,832
She can bake you to death.

257
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:06,880
She can murder you.

258
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:07,832
Just murder you.

259
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:10,040
Hello, sir.
- Sir..

260
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,624
Sorry.

261
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,499
It's okay.

262
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:26,489
Where were you?

263
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,999
- I had gone for an outing.

264
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,582
Alone?
- Yes.

265
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,582
Brother.
- Here she is.

266
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,457
Papa. When did you come?
- Just now.

267
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:39,499
How are you?
- I'm fine.

268
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,332
Are you all right?
- Absolutely.

269
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:53,798
I swear on my dead mother.

270
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:55,082
She's insatiable.

271
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:58,624
I was so worn out and sore..
couldn't get up for two days.

272
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:00,249
I was hurting.

273
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:05,207
By God, sir.
No one can beat Paro.

274
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,540
You're lying.

275
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,082
Sir, may my dead mother die again if I'm lying.

276
00:22:09,166 --> 00:22:11,499
She wanted to do it just a while back.

277
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:13,165
I refused.
I said, "No."

278
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,374
Why are you glaring at me like that, sir?

279
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:21,957
All you have to do is just ask and she'll come running to you.

280
00:22:23,541 --> 00:22:25,499
But I'm very surprised, sir.

281
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:28,054
You haven't done it with her yet.

282
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:28,999
I'm shocked.

283
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:43,457
Hey.
What did you do?

284
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:51,540
What happened?

285
00:22:52,791 --> 00:22:55,415
Please go out.
- But what happened?

286
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,082
Leave me alone, please.

287
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:03,999
What happened?
- Nothing.

288
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:06,207
London has ruined his head.

289
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,082
At least find out what happened.

290
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:09,790
Let's go out.
I'll tell you.

291
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:00,999
What are you doing?

292
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,665
You asked me to do something.

293
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:05,665
So, here I am.

294
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,999
Put your hands up.

295
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,957
You're so hairy.

296
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,624
You're such an expert.

297
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,624
How many have you done it with?

298
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,915
Get your hands off.

299
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:48,332
I said take your hands off.

300
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:54,290
Where are you going?
- Let me go.

301
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:57,165
Tell me what happened.

302
00:25:57,458 --> 00:25:58,665
I said let me go.

303
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:00,040
You..

304
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,332
Characterless.

305
00:26:46,833 --> 00:26:48,004
Have you come, Paro?

306
00:26:48,005 --> 00:26:48,999
Where were you?

307
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:50,415
Aunt had asked for it.

308
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,499
She was falling short of mattresses.

309
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,687
Come, dear.
Your dad wants to talk to you.

310
00:26:56,688 --> 00:26:57,749
Let's go inside.

311
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:05,749
Yes, tell me.

312
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,332
Sit.
- No. Tell me.

313
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:17,249
See! Have you met the Delhi businessman Bhuvan Singh..

314
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:19,249
..who's here for the wedding?

315
00:27:19,458 --> 00:27:20,915
Bhuvan Singh who?

316
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:24,040
That girl Rasika's brother.

317
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:26,179
He likes you.

318
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,665
He wants to marry you.

319
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,749
So what if he likes me?

320
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,540
They're very well-off.

321
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:36,165
I will marry only Dev.

322
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,207
And will wait for him till he marries me.

323
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:39,582
Have you gone mad?

324
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:42,999
Why should Satpal marry his son to you?

325
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:46,165
Why shouldn't he?
I've made lassi (buttermilk) for him all my life.

326
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,915
He loves me so much.

327
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:51,540
That's okay.
We're not in his league.

328
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:55,999
And Dev's studied in London, you've studied here.

329
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:59,415
I'm the college-topper,
Dev barely scraped through his exams.

330
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,540
At least, try talking to him.

331
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:02,999
I don't want to embarrass myself.

332
00:28:03,041 --> 00:28:06,082
You can't embarrass yourself,
but you can embarrass your daughter.

333
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:10,249
Meet Bhuvan once.

334
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:13,082
Bring him close to me and I'll chop him into pieces.

335
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:15,374
Paro. Dear..

336
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:17,999
Paro. Paro.

337
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:19,457
Listen to me, dear.

338
00:28:19,541 --> 00:28:21,290
Where are you going?

339
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:26,707
Move aside. Let go.

340
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,665
Paro.
- Father is losing his head.

341
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,999
He needs treatment.

342
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:36,940
He's right.

343
00:28:36,941 --> 00:28:40,290
Why should Satpal marry his son to you?

344
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:42,382
Even Dev has grown up.

345
00:28:42,383 --> 00:28:44,624
Who knows where his heart is.

346
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:45,895
I know where it is.

347
00:28:45,896 --> 00:28:48,207
He gave it to me when we were kids.

348
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:52,346
The bucket is overflowing, my dear.

349
00:28:52,347 --> 00:28:53,749
- I know. I know!

350
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:59,999
Paro. Paro, where are going?

351
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:04,674
What kind of a chef is he?

352
00:29:04,675 --> 00:29:06,707
Look what he has done to the flatbreads.

353
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:08,999
He has burnt them.

354
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:10,302
Do your own job.

355
00:29:10,303 --> 00:29:12,207
Don't interfere in his.

356
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:14,707
Is everything all right?
- Yes.

357
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,486
Finish this work fast.

358
00:29:19,487 --> 00:29:22,457
We've to sing and dance too. Keep it here.

359
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:25,040
Paro, come here.

360
00:29:25,708 --> 00:29:27,665
Take this cup of tea to your uncle.

361
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,499
I don't know what is wrong with this girl..

362
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:30,996
It's very tasty.

363
00:29:30,997 --> 00:29:33,999
- Please, take it.
- No, enough.

364
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:35,518
Paro, come join us.
Come.

365
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:36,249
Eat something.

366
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:37,408
Later.

367
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:39,656
- Where are you off to?

368
00:29:39,657 --> 00:29:41,707
She's very strange.

369
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,707
You are Bhuvan's sister, right?

370
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,707
Please don't tell my brother anything.

371
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:05,165
Get out.

372
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:11,915
What were you doing with her?

373
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:14,790
The same that you do with Sunil.

374
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:16,415
With Sunil?

375
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:18,665
What did I do with Sunil?

376
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:27,374
Tell me.

377
00:30:28,708 --> 00:30:30,749
Is that why you broke his head?

378
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,330
You just go from here.

379
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,540
- I didn't do anything with that lousy man.

380
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,249
I know everything.

381
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:38,874
Sunil told you?

382
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,999
When did he tell you all that?

383
00:30:48,333 --> 00:30:49,540
Exactly before I broke the bottle on him.

384
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:51,999
Leave or else I'll do the same to you.

385
00:30:57,541 --> 00:30:58,665
You hypocrite.

386
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:01,665
You broke the bottle on him after
taking Rasika out in the car?

387
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,332
What you do is right.
And if I do..

388
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:07,957
Will you please leave me alone?

389
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:09,290
I'm leaving.

390
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,457
I came to tell you that
I have received a marriage proposal.

391
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:19,040
Good.

392
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:21,374
Go ruin someone else's life.

393
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:24,124
Anyway, you're not good enough to get married to me.

394
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:28,499
A manager's daughter will always remain so.

395
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:32,874
Look at yourself.
Unkempt hair..

396
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:36,624
..lousy clothes.
Wants to marry me..

397
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:38,957
Illiterate.

398
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:49,749
"My dear.."

399
00:31:51,708 --> 00:32:00,040
"I don't think I want.."

400
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:04,915
"..this love thing any more."

401
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:08,624
"My dear.."

402
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:20,165
"I don't think I want this love thing any more."

403
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:41,040
"My dear.."

404
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:44,707
"I don't think I want.."

405
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,624
"..this love thing any more."

406
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:56,790
"My dear.."

407
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,374
Brother.
- Yes?

408
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:21,540
Your heartthrob.

409
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:25,499
You idiot.
What did I do with you, you idiot?

410
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:26,808
Tell me, what did I do with you?

411
00:33:26,809 --> 00:33:27,624
- What are you doing?

412
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:28,604
Get out of my way.

413
00:33:28,605 --> 00:33:29,999
I'll dump you in the well.

414
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:30,800
Have you gone mad?

415
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:32,790
- You idiot. Come here!
What did you say to him?

416
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:34,915
What did I do?

417
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,549
What are you..
- You idiot.

418
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,582
Stop. You idiot.

419
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:39,274
Where are you running to?

420
00:33:39,275 --> 00:33:41,332
Stop.
- Run. She has gone mad.

421
00:33:41,416 --> 00:33:42,203
Paro, what are you doing?

422
00:33:42,204 --> 00:33:42,707
- Idiot.
Wait.

423
00:33:42,791 --> 00:33:43,367
Sunil, run.

424
00:33:43,368 --> 00:33:44,832
- Stop.
I won't spare you.

425
00:33:44,916 --> 00:33:47,615
Why are you running away?

426
00:33:47,616 --> 00:33:50,207
Stop.
Stop, you idiot.

427
00:33:50,416 --> 00:33:52,290
She has gone crazy.

428
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:55,582
Paro..

429
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,388
Paro, what are you doing?

430
00:33:57,389 --> 00:33:58,499
Have you gone mad?

431
00:33:58,708 --> 00:34:00,082
Hey, Paro.

432
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,926
Give the matchbox.

433
00:34:01,927 --> 00:34:04,540
- You'll tear my shirt.
Let go.

434
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:05,775
Give the matchbox.

435
00:34:05,776 --> 00:34:08,332
- That's the only spare shirt I have..

436
00:34:08,416 --> 00:34:10,874
Paro, don't burn it.
Please.

437
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:12,828
Paro, don't..
- He burnt my dreams.

438
00:34:12,829 --> 00:34:14,665
I will burn down his house.
- Paro..

439
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:16,374
Forgive Sunil.

440
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:41,415
"I could embrace you, give you my life always."

441
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,999
"Shot at my heart by your double barrelled gaze."

442
00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:47,124
"Shot at my heart.."

443
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,457
"I could embrace you, give you my life always."

444
00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:55,290
"Shot at my heart by your double barrelled gaze."

445
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:58,165
"My heart's like a child's though you treat it not so mild."

446
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,124
"I don't know what to do about it now."

447
00:35:00,208 --> 00:35:11,790
"I should've watched that thing,
side stepped your beauty sting."

448
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,999
"You must be the breeze that
blew from the Chenaab (river)."

449
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:28,874
"You must be the glory, the beauty of Punjab."

450
00:35:28,958 --> 00:35:31,624
"Let's do it."

451
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:34,374
"You must be the breeze that blew from the Chenaab."

452
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:37,582
"You must be the glory, the beauty of Punjab."

453
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:42,790
"You came into my life and left me a sweet ruin."

454
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:45,499
"Your sweet smile will now be my undoing."

455
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:48,290
"When you sway that hip or pout that precious lip."

456
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:50,457
"You unleash another storm, sink another ship."

457
00:35:50,541 --> 00:36:01,665
"I should've watched that thing
side stepped your beauty sting."

458
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:16,249
"The way you look, the way you move, leaves me in a whirl."

459
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:19,415
"I don't know what to do about you, dizzle-dazzle girl."

460
00:36:21,958 --> 00:36:24,582
"The way you look, the way you move, leaves me in a whirl."

461
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:27,832
"I don't know what to do
about you, dizzle-dazzle girl."

462
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:32,957
"You're the heady brew from the fields that gets us high."

463
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,749
"You've got every boy in town dying to catch your eye."

464
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:37,915
"You're just like Juliet, beauty so renowned."

465
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,165
Bhuvan's getting married?

466
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:42,832
"I should've watched that thing,
side stepped your beauty sting."

467
00:36:42,916 --> 00:36:44,165
Congratulations.

468
00:36:46,916 --> 00:36:48,999
No, no. You won't lose your job.

469
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,665
I am sorry.
I had gone mad.

470
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:54,624
I am ready to fall at Paro's feet.

471
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:56,624
You won't do any such thing.

472
00:36:56,708 --> 00:36:58,709
She will be getting married soon.

473
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,415
You got it?

474
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:02,749
I know she is getting married, but I might lose my job.

475
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:04,207
How much have you drunk?

476
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:06,915
You're ranting continuously about your job.

477
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,540
"Shot at my heart by your double barrelled gaze."

478
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:14,457
"By your double barrelled gaze."

479
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:28,790
Paro's looking very beautiful.

480
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:32,582
Yes.

481
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:35,965
She's getting married.
Did she tell you?

482
00:37:35,966 --> 00:37:36,790
- Yes.

483
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,665
I don't know which fairy you're waiting for.

484
00:37:40,333 --> 00:37:42,249
I always had this dream..

485
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:45,915
Of bringing her from that house to this, as a bride..

486
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:48,207
..so she would always remain my daughter.

487
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:51,624
But London has ruined your taste.

488
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:54,665
You prefer vodka over whisky.

489
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,832
Fish over chicken..

490
00:37:56,916 --> 00:38:00,999
Waif-like stick figures over a real curvy woman.

491
00:38:01,625 --> 00:38:03,415
You are a hopeless case.

492
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:26,874
"I'm all tangled up in this spinning wheel of love."

493
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:30,624
"Crumpled with the pain, from under and above."

494
00:38:34,208 --> 00:38:37,832
"I'm all tangled up in this spinning wheel of love."

495
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,040
"Crumpled with the pain, from under and above."

496
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:44,790
"You spun that wheel, I tottered, had a fall."

497
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:48,124
"Now I think I'm finished, I think I've lost my all."

498
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:52,249
"I don't think I want this love thing anymore."

499
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:55,332
"God knows what all this spinning around was for."

500
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:59,749
"I don't think I want this love thing anymore."

501
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:02,665
"God knows what all this spinning around was for."

502
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,915
"I don't think.."

503
00:39:18,416 --> 00:39:22,249
"Your eyes intoxicate like opium smoked."

504
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:25,999
"You glow and smolder like embers stoked."

505
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:33,207
"Your eyes intoxicate like opium smoked."

506
00:39:33,291 --> 00:39:36,582
"You glow and smolder like embers stoked."

507
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:40,290
"What we shared is pieces, what answers can I give.."

508
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:43,665
"There's nothing more to say, no reason left to live."

509
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:16,378
Hello.
Thank you.

510
00:40:16,379 --> 00:40:17,999
Thank you very much.

511
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,062
Thank you.

512
00:40:19,063 --> 00:40:20,999
- Uncle, where's Dev?
- Dev?

513
00:40:23,541 --> 00:40:24,790
No idea!

514
00:40:33,666 --> 00:40:36,249
Paro, what are you doing here?

515
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,832
Come, let's dance.

516
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:42,999
Paro.. Paro..

517
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:47,415
"My heart croons.."

518
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:50,915
Careful.

519
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,999
"One, two, three, four, six."

520
00:40:54,875 --> 00:40:57,374
"Could I melt this heart into a tune?"

521
00:40:57,458 --> 00:40:59,457
"Get my heartbeat to croon."

522
00:40:59,541 --> 00:41:03,290
"Am I smoking hot or what?

523
00:41:03,916 --> 00:41:05,665
"In my chest is a fire."

524
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:07,915
"My desire's on a pyre."

525
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,832
"Darling, I don't know what to say."

526
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:14,540
"I saw dreams of heaven."

527
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:17,124
"But they all went to hell."

528
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:23,247
"It's all gone up in smoke.

529
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:25,374
To my world I bid farewell."

530
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:29,957
"God help whoever gets bitten by this bug."

531
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,374
"The devil takes your beauty, the devil takes your love."

532
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:39,499
"The devil takes your emotional torture from above."

533
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:47,499
"The devil takes your beauty, the devil takes your love."

534
00:41:47,583 --> 00:41:52,499
"The devil takes your emotional torture from above."

535
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,749
"Go away, oh, love."

536
00:41:57,833 --> 00:42:00,374
"Oh, love."

537
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:04,915
"The devil takes your beauty, the devil takes your love."

538
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,915
"The devil takes your emotional torture from above."

539
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:43,999
"This heart is torn by a tragedy, tragedy."

540
00:42:44,083 --> 00:42:46,192
"A paradise lies plundered.

541
00:42:46,193 --> 00:42:48,457
Its roses dried and dying."

542
00:42:48,541 --> 00:42:52,749
"This heart is torn by a tragedy, tragedy."

543
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,189
"A paradise lies plundered.

544
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:57,540
Its roses dried and dying."

545
00:42:59,416 --> 00:43:01,707
"Say why did you ditch me?"

546
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:03,874
"Now take my life too, kill me."

547
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:10,415
"Say why did you ditch me?"

548
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,582
"Now take my life too, kill me."

549
00:43:12,666 --> 00:43:15,624
"Go away, love."

550
00:43:17,041 --> 00:43:21,332
"The devil takes your beauty, the devil takes your love."

551
00:43:21,416 --> 00:43:26,207
"The devil takes your emotional torture from above."

552
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:34,499
"The devil takes your beauty, the devil takes your love."

553
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:39,332
"The devil takes your emotional torture from above."

554
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:43,540
"Go away, oh, love."

555
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:46,957
"Oh, love.."

556
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:51,874
"The devil takes your beauty, the devil takes your love."

557
00:43:51,958 --> 00:44:14,249
"The devil takes your emotional torture from above."

558
00:44:17,208 --> 00:44:18,332
What happened?

559
00:44:18,416 --> 00:44:22,415
What happened to him?
- Dev.

560
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,665
Leni.

561
00:44:41,208 --> 00:44:42,874
Wake up.

562
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,499
Baby, wake up.

563
00:45:02,875 --> 00:45:04,915
Good morning.

564
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:13,999
"1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1 0, 1 1 ..
12, 1 3.."

565
00:45:14,333 --> 00:45:16,415
Leni!
- "1 , 2, 3.."

566
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:39,624
"The seasons set on my lashes."

567
00:45:40,458 --> 00:45:47,540
"I drink the moment, each drop splashes."

568
00:45:48,291 --> 00:45:55,624
"A sun-drop on my forehead falls."

569
00:45:56,083 --> 00:46:03,040
"To myself I make whispered calls."

570
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:34,749
"This is what my life's about."

571
00:46:47,708 --> 00:46:49,415
Leni, you're the best.

572
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:53,999
Hey, stop.
Why are you filming me?

573
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:57,957
Just for my personal use.

574
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:11,927
However is your fate and heart...

575
00:47:11,928 --> 00:47:14,415
- Your the best, Leni.

576
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:21,040
"Green branches in a blossomed daze."

577
00:47:22,875 --> 00:47:27,915
"I've splashed colour on all my dreams."

578
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,774
"My heart shines a thousand gleams."

579
00:47:32,775 --> 00:47:35,999
- Leni, you're the best.

580
00:47:38,583 --> 00:47:46,707
"Nature smiles.."
- Leni, you're the best.

581
00:47:47,208 --> 00:47:57,624
"To myself I make whispered calls."

582
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:13,290
"This is what my life's about."

583
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:16,832
Leni, you're the best.

584
00:48:17,583 --> 00:48:20,415
Leni, you're the best.
Characterless girl.

585
00:48:37,791 --> 00:48:38,957
Helen..

586
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,374
Helen, it will be fine.

587
00:48:45,416 --> 00:48:47,915
Taran Yadav, the 28-year-old who made the..

588
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,165
..objectionable MMS involving a student of..

589
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:56,040
..Mathur International School, New Delhi has been arrested.

590
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:58,582
Taran claims the student is his lover.

591
00:48:58,666 --> 00:49:01,374
The girl caught in the storm is a minor studying in..

592
00:49:01,458 --> 00:49:04,415
..class 12 of the same school.

593
00:49:18,958 --> 00:49:21,165
Go inside. 
- Papa..

594
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,999
I said go back in.

595
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:54,624
Helen.

596
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,665
Helen.
- Leni.

597
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:18,207
Come inside.

598
00:50:18,541 --> 00:50:24,707
Mom, I'm just going for a walk.

599
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,699
Look, I'm sorry for what I did.

600
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:28,374
Okay?

601
00:50:28,541 --> 00:50:31,499
I'm not going to go and do it with everybody.

602
00:50:31,583 --> 00:50:32,874
How dare you.

603
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:35,665
Mom.
- No more Delhi.

604
00:50:36,916 --> 00:50:39,957
Helen, no.
Helen.. No..

605
00:50:48,375 --> 00:50:51,332
I saw what she did.

606
00:50:51,833 --> 00:50:53,790
She knew what she was doing.

607
00:50:55,625 --> 00:50:57,290
How could you watch it, Dad?

608
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:02,290
Did you get off on it, you sick man.

609
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:03,582
Leni.
- Just shut up.

610
00:51:04,125 --> 00:51:05,738
I didn't sleep with him.
- Shut up.

611
00:51:05,739 --> 00:51:07,082
- I didn't sleep with anyone.

612
00:51:07,166 --> 00:51:08,999
I'm still a virgin, you hypocrite.

613
00:51:09,041 --> 00:51:10,790
Shut up. I told you, shut up.

614
00:51:11,041 --> 00:51:11,732
Do you want to hit me?

615
00:51:11,733 --> 00:51:12,832
Do you want to hit me?
- Please..

616
00:51:12,916 --> 00:51:15,999
Come on, hit me.
You coward.

617
00:51:22,625 --> 00:51:24,915
How could he watch it?
- I know.

618
00:52:08,916 --> 00:52:12,082
"Every beat of my heart.."

619
00:52:12,541 --> 00:52:15,915
"I follow the dream I have in my heart."

620
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:30,290
"Life plays a cruel game of hide and seek."

621
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:34,207
"Sometimes near and sometimes far."

622
00:52:34,291 --> 00:52:37,832
"It makes us laugh."

623
00:52:37,916 --> 00:52:43,499
"It comes and goes, comes and goes, does life."

624
00:52:47,708 --> 00:52:48,999
Aunt, don't worry.

625
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,790
I can understand.

626
00:52:53,083 --> 00:52:54,658
Even I've seen it.

627
00:52:54,659 --> 00:52:57,457
But I still want
to marry her.

628
00:52:59,166 --> 00:53:02,290
She's only 1 7.
- I'll wait.

629
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:07,832
My mother..
She got married when she was just 15.

630
00:53:08,666 --> 00:53:09,832
I swear.

631
00:53:14,166 --> 00:53:15,415
Hello.

632
00:53:26,416 --> 00:53:28,832
Natha Singh.
What are you all doing?

633
00:53:28,916 --> 00:53:30,832
You haven't sent the potatoes yet.

634
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:36,999
These weird books in English that
you keep reading are spoiling you.

635
00:53:37,541 --> 00:53:39,915
Why don't you mind your own business, Grandma?

636
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:42,207
How dare you answer back!

637
00:53:42,875 --> 00:53:46,999
First, you killed my son, now you want to kill us all?

638
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:48,290
What happened?

639
00:53:48,375 --> 00:53:51,915
Look at her staring at me, like she will kill me too.

640
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,124
I tell you. 
Let's just bury her in the field..

641
00:53:54,208 --> 00:53:56,582
..only way to save whatever respect we've got left.

642
00:53:56,666 --> 00:54:00,624
Look down or I'll gouge your eyes out.. witch..

643
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:02,915
..and parade you naked in the village blind.

644
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,124
Understood?

645
00:54:05,666 --> 00:54:06,999
Mom.

646
00:54:09,791 --> 00:54:11,249
I miss you.

647
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:14,957
Mom, I'm sorry.

648
00:54:16,958 --> 00:54:19,915
I don't want to be here.

649
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,114
I'll go anywhere you want me to.

650
00:54:23,115 --> 00:54:24,540
I'll do anything.

651
00:54:26,583 --> 00:54:29,082
Mom, please.
I know you're there.

652
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:30,665
Please pick up the phone.

653
00:54:31,166 --> 00:54:33,874
Mom, I love you.

654
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:37,993
Mom, please pick up the phone.

655
00:54:37,994 --> 00:54:39,457
I know you're there.

656
00:54:40,041 --> 00:54:41,855
Please.. please.

657
00:54:41,856 --> 00:54:44,915
Please pick up the phone.

658
00:54:57,958 --> 00:54:59,290
How much?

659
00:55:15,416 --> 00:55:18,290
"Every beat of my heart."

660
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,415
"I follow the dream I have in my heart.."

661
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:32,290
"Life plays a cruel game of hide and seek."

662
00:55:32,375 --> 00:55:37,540
"With a trinket, with an anklet in my leg.."

663
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:41,165
"..I'll dance with zest."

664
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:44,415
"Here swings.."

665
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:48,707
"Here swings my heart."

666
00:55:48,791 --> 00:55:52,207
"Here swings.."

667
00:55:59,458 --> 00:56:14,040
"Life plays a cruel game of hide and seek."

668
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:17,790
"It disappears and then gives us a peek."

669
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:21,540
"It makes us laugh."

670
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:25,957
"It comes and goes, comes and goes, does life."

671
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,661
Hi. Hi, Tara.

672
00:56:27,662 --> 00:56:29,832
It's Leni here.

673
00:56:31,916 --> 00:56:33,995
Yes, I'm back in Delhi.

674
00:56:33,996 --> 00:56:36,707
Listen, I've nowhere to go..

675
00:56:38,208 --> 00:56:41,374
Yes.. sure, I understand.

676
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:45,749
Hello. 
Yes, Leni here..

677
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:57,832
"Makes us dance, does life."

678
00:56:58,541 --> 00:57:04,040
"Makes us cry, does life."

679
00:57:04,125 --> 00:57:05,999
"Makes us cry, does life.."

680
00:57:06,083 --> 00:57:13,374
"Makes us dance, does life."

681
00:57:13,458 --> 00:57:20,832
"Life is like a flower that blossoms."

682
00:57:20,916 --> 00:57:25,915
"Some are fortunate to be happy and some to be sad."

683
00:57:27,791 --> 00:57:31,374
"Life plays a cruel game of hide and seek."

684
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:33,207
Hey.. Stop. Stop.

685
00:57:33,291 --> 00:57:34,055
Listen. Hi.

686
00:57:34,056 --> 00:57:35,999
I know that you're hungry.

687
00:57:36,083 --> 00:57:36,417
Come, come.

688
00:57:36,418 --> 00:57:37,540
We'll eat something together, okay?

689
00:57:37,625 --> 00:57:39,190
Why?
Are you throwing a party?

690
00:57:39,191 --> 00:57:40,200
- Don't worry. 
Come.

691
00:57:40,201 --> 00:57:40,957
Come with me.

692
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:43,999
We have women from all over the world.

693
00:57:44,416 --> 00:57:48,374
Easy money.
And you're beautiful.

694
00:57:52,791 --> 00:57:54,297
Come.
This way.

695
00:57:54,298 --> 00:57:56,707
The biggest room here.

696
00:57:57,083 --> 00:57:58,707
It's been vacant for the last three months.

697
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,999
This room is our way to tell customers that..

698
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:02,999
..she is numero uno (the best).

699
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,707
Exclusively for connoisseurs.

700
00:58:12,791 --> 00:58:15,249
And we're in no hurry.

701
00:58:16,416 --> 00:58:17,874
You're still a minor.

702
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,165
You don't have to do what you don't like..

703
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:24,540
..and till you don't wish to.

704
00:58:34,041 --> 00:58:35,665
Want some?

705
00:58:38,416 --> 00:58:40,499
It evaporates bad memories

706
00:58:41,625 --> 00:58:44,707
Stay here. Complete your school.

707
00:58:44,958 --> 00:58:46,374
Take your exams.

708
00:58:47,041 --> 00:58:49,249
Join a college, study what you want to.

709
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,989
A number of foreigner girls study here.

710
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:54,707
And also work with us.

711
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:58,374
And here, everybody has fixed time for studies and work.

712
00:58:58,666 --> 00:59:00,457
How wonderful.

Come down. 
Come.

756
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:13,040
I brought this..

757

For me?

758
01:01:16,333 --> 01:01:19,332
"It calls out to my love.."

759
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:20,707
You're naked..

760
01:01:21,625 --> 01:01:23,415
Why are you naked..

761
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:27,665

762
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,082

Oh, yes.

769
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,415
I will eat you up.

Oh, my God!

772
01:01:57,208 --> 01:01:58,457
Chanda!

773
01:02:01,833 --> 01:02:06,999
Carefully.

774
01:02:07,083 --> 01:02:08,665
Welcome home.

775
01:02:43,541 --> 01:02:44,915
Paro..

776
01:02:52,416 --> 01:02:54,790
"A scream rose inside."

777
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:56,957
"Loud, thick, strong it cried."

778
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,749
"It sizzled, coursed through every vein."

779
01:03:01,541 --> 01:03:03,832
"Yesterday stood so tall."

780
01:03:03,916 --> 01:03:06,082
"Today had a fall."

781
01:03:06,166 --> 01:03:09,624

782
01:03:10,666 --> 01:03:15,124
"All things I lay eyes on turn to soot."

783
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:19,665
"My heart is ashes, I crash and burn."

784
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:24,124
"This moment hides a scalded truth."

785
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:28,457
"My heart is ashes, I crash and burn."

786
01:03:28,708 --> 01:03:32,999
"Leave me now, leave me, leave me now far from my sight."

787
01:03:33,041 --> 01:03:37,665
"Leave me now leave me, leave me now.."

"Leave me now leave me, leave me now.."

790

"My heart is ashes."

791
01:03:51,583 --> 01:04:01,540
"I crash and burn."

792
01:04:07,833 --> 01:04:10,457
I need some, Charlie.
- Okay.

793
01:04:25,333 --> 01:04:26,665
Excuse me.

Not easy to give up, is it?

800
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:26,999
I know.
Rich spoilt kid.

801
01:05:31,666 --> 01:05:32,957
Understood?

802
01:05:48,041 --> 01:05:49,665
Why are you taking your clothes off?

01:05:50,916 --> 01:05:52,040
No?

804
01:05:53,666 --> 01:05:54,999

Yes, sir.

Will you get some there?

01:07:20,250 --> 01:07:21,832
You'll get nothing.

822
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:24,749
If you want to drink, you'll have to drive to the border.

823
01:07:33,791 --> 01:07:35,249
What are you doing, brother?

824
01:07:35,333 --> 01:07:36,064
Don't go there.

"That's how we do it."

863

"God knows what lies ahead."

869
01:10:59,708 --> 01:11:01,165
"That's how we do it."

870
01:11:01,875 --> 01:11:07,582
"My mind echoes like an empty well."

871
01:11:09,666 --> 01:11:15,082

872

So, how was it last night?

887
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,562
This is Delhi, my friend.

888
01:14:48,563 --> 01:14:50,124
Here you enjoy a girl..

889
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:53,957
..relish a girl, but never keep one.

890
01:14:54,875 --> 01:14:56,499
You have to pay dearly for it.

891
01:14:57,083 --> 01:14:59,227
It can cost you your life.

892
01:14:59,228 --> 01:15:01,207
The watch.. it's nice.

893
01:15:06,791 --> 01:15:09,457
Sattu, I want a car.

894
01:15:10,375 --> 01:15:11,790
Please tell the manager.

895
01:15:16,416 --> 01:15:17,749
Hey. Pause. Pause.

896
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:19,583
Hello.

897
01:15:19,584 --> 01:15:21,915
- I'm in Delhi.
 Let's meet.

898
01:15:22,791 --> 01:15:24,082
Where can we meet?

899
01:15:25,583 --> 01:15:26,999
Where do I meet you?

900
01:15:27,291 --> 01:15:27,999
It's him.

901
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,832
- Your brother's back from his honeymoon?

902
01:15:30,916 --> 01:15:32,499
Yes, long back.

903
01:15:32,791 --> 01:15:35,415
Should I pick you up from your place?

904
01:15:36,166 --> 01:15:38,249
Give me the address. See you.

905
01:15:49,166 --> 01:15:55,499
"A luscious fever slowly rises."

906
01:15:56,833 --> 01:16:03,207
"This desire hides no surprises."

907
01:16:04,583 --> 01:16:11,249
"Your name's dug deep on Delhi's throne."

908
01:16:12,375 --> 01:16:17,874
"Your hair hangs sentinel over eyes of stone."

909
01:16:19,333 --> 01:16:27,249
"Beautiful stranger.."

910
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:30,124
"Feel a luscious fever slowly rise."

911
01:16:30,208 --> 01:16:34,499
"I'm your beautiful stranger."

912
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:42,957
O Stranger...

913
01:16:43,291 --> 01:16:45,624
"Lord save me from this surprise."

914
01:16:45,708 --> 01:16:50,124
"I'm your beautiful stranger."

915
01:16:50,791 --> 01:16:52,415
"That's how we do it."

916
01:16:56,541 --> 01:16:57,999
Where are you?

917
01:16:59,583 --> 01:17:00,475
You could've told me.

918
01:17:00,476 --> 01:17:01,665
I could have got the car..

919
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:07,207
You could've told me, I'd have brought the car.

920
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:11,582
Where are we going?

921
01:17:12,458 --> 01:17:13,749
To my hotel.

922
01:17:14,458 --> 01:17:15,874
What will we do there?

923
01:17:19,916 --> 01:17:22,457
Can't we just go somewhere where we can sit and talk?

924
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:28,040
Do you even care about me?

925
01:17:33,125 --> 01:17:35,788
So, all that you want to do is sleep with me.

926
01:17:35,789 --> 01:17:36,540
- Don't you?

927
01:17:42,625 --> 01:17:43,429
You know what?

928
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:45,957
I really regret everything that we shared.

929
01:17:46,125 --> 01:17:49,290
And I think that you're the biggest jerk ever.

930
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:52,957
Sick.

931
01:17:59,958 --> 01:18:17,749
"Leave me now leave me, leave me now, far from my sight."

932
01:18:18,083 --> 01:18:20,332
"The splinters of my fractured pleas."

933
01:18:20,416 --> 01:18:22,582
"Stab into my memories."

934
01:18:22,666 --> 01:18:31,749
"And blood flows out where tears should."

935
01:18:45,291 --> 01:18:49,790
"My eyes are now deceit, just like your devil love."

936
01:18:49,875 --> 01:18:54,290
"The devil takes your emotional torture from above."

937
01:18:54,375 --> 01:18:58,832
"My eyes are now deceit, just like your devil love."

938
01:18:58,916 --> 01:19:03,665
"The devil takes your emotional torture from above."

939
01:19:09,583 --> 01:19:11,124
Yes, sir.
Tell me.

940
01:19:11,208 --> 01:19:13,207
Chunni, I need a girl.

941
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:16,165
Where did you take me that night?

942
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:23,415
Leave your credit card here.

943
01:19:24,083 --> 01:19:25,665
It's Saturday today.

944
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,124
Come.

945
01:19:27,875 --> 01:19:29,540
I've reserved a suite for you.

946
01:19:29,625 --> 01:19:34,499
Booked in advance.
Come with me.

947
01:19:40,833 --> 01:19:41,499
Sit.

948
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:44,165
I'll be back. 
Relax.

949
01:20:12,916 --> 01:20:14,832
Baby.

950
01:20:15,166 --> 01:20:17,082
She's already busy with somebody.

951
01:20:18,208 --> 01:20:20,999
Do you want the regular ones or someone exclusive?

952
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:22,499
Keep patience.

953
01:20:24,083 --> 01:20:29,624
My God, no. 
Yes.

954
01:20:36,083 --> 01:20:37,744
Please come.
Come.

955
01:20:37,745 --> 01:20:41,249
- I'll be there in 15 minutes.
Yes.

956
01:20:42,416 --> 01:20:48,207
Hello, yes.
Of course, it's me speaking, baby.

957
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:55,457
How are you?
Wow.

958
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:58,124
Sit. Why are you standing there?

959
01:20:58,208 --> 01:20:59,874
Are you ready for a wild night?

960
01:20:59,958 --> 01:21:02,415
Yes, you are soon going to be with me.

961
01:21:02,791 --> 01:21:05,082
Yes, I will do everything..

962
01:21:07,666 --> 01:21:08,915
In Tamil?

963
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,332
Okay. I'll speak in Tamil.

964
01:21:12,541 --> 01:21:14,832
I'll put my hand in your shirt.

965
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:21,749
Is it enough or you want more?

966
01:21:22,041 --> 01:21:24,499
Go little down.

967
01:21:24,541 --> 01:21:25,821
What're you saying?

968
01:21:25,822 --> 01:21:27,707
It seems you're very fast.

969
01:21:27,916 --> 01:21:32,415
We will do it slowly.

970
01:21:32,541 --> 01:21:35,540
That's how you like it, right?

971
01:21:38,333 --> 01:21:40,707
In French?

972
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,376
I'll be waiting outside.

973
01:21:47,377 --> 01:21:51,040
You take your time.
Enjoy yourself.

974
01:22:39,375 --> 01:22:42,082
Baby, was that good for you?

975
01:22:44,291 --> 01:22:46,624
Okay, baby.
 Bye.

976
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:57,665
Hello.

977
01:22:58,833 --> 01:23:00,874
He took 11 minutes.
Yes.

978
01:23:08,041 --> 01:23:11,165
Hi.

979
01:23:20,958 --> 01:23:22,749
Last time you passed out before we could..

980
01:23:26,458 --> 01:23:27,624
Yes.

981
01:23:28,208 --> 01:23:29,332
I'm Chanda.

982
01:23:30,833 --> 01:23:32,124
I'm Dev.

983
01:23:39,666 --> 01:23:42,249
Can I get a drink?
- Why?

984
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:44,862
I'll bathe in it.

985
01:23:44,863 --> 01:23:46,624
- Shall I bathe you?

986
01:23:49,916 --> 01:23:51,332
Vodka.. if you have it.

987
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:09,207
The mini-bar charges are extra.

988
01:24:22,791 --> 01:24:24,582
Why are you so angry?

989
01:24:32,541 --> 01:24:35,040
I can calm you down in a couple of minutes.

990
01:24:36,083 --> 01:24:38,082
I'll rip you apart.
- That too..

991
01:24:53,625 --> 01:24:55,124
Let's start?

992
01:24:56,708 --> 01:24:57,874
No.

993
01:24:59,541 --> 01:25:00,749
Why not?

994
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,957
Because I don't like your face.

995
01:25:07,125 --> 01:25:09,832
Am I that ugly?
- Uglier.

996
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,999
Then where's the pretty one?

997
01:25:25,541 --> 01:25:26,999
Do you want some?

998
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:46,874
Why are you dressed up like a school girl?

999
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:49,057
All-American Girls.

1000
01:25:49,058 --> 01:25:50,915
Have you seen the series?

1001
01:25:51,708 --> 01:25:52,915
No.

1002
01:25:53,833 --> 01:25:55,040
Would you like to watch it?

1003
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:00,624
Erotic.

1004
01:26:01,291 --> 01:26:02,624
Want to watch it?

1005
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,665
Have seen a lot of them in the UK.

1006
01:26:07,625 --> 01:26:10,415
Is it? Were you in the UK?

1007
01:26:10,833 --> 01:26:11,999
London.

1008
01:26:12,458 --> 01:26:15,040
But you don't talk like that.

1009
01:26:25,958 --> 01:26:27,082
How old are you?

1010
01:26:27,208 --> 01:26:29,790
Old enough to go to bed with you, darling.

1011
01:26:30,041 --> 01:26:32,540
I'm sure you're an animal in bed.

1012
01:26:32,625 --> 01:26:34,165
Will you shut that lousy accent?

1013
01:26:34,416 --> 01:26:36,915
Your bird must be really chuffed.

1014
01:26:37,166 --> 01:26:40,214
Oh, Dev. 
Yes, Dev.

1015
01:26:40,215 --> 01:26:42,415
Don't stop.

1016
01:26:42,625 --> 01:26:45,915
Oh, Wow. 
My Dev..

1017
01:26:48,708 --> 01:26:51,165
Oh. 
You're hot.

1018
01:26:56,041 --> 01:26:57,499
Superman.

1019
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:01,790
Don't tell anyone I did that..

1020
01:27:02,208 --> 01:27:04,207
I don't want a queue outside my suite.

1021
01:27:08,291 --> 01:27:09,874
My God.

1022
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:12,624
Looks like you got your money's worth?

1023
01:27:13,666 --> 01:27:14,790
What did you do, Chanda?

1024
01:27:14,875 --> 01:27:18,165
Not much, but I was about to..

1025
01:27:18,625 --> 01:27:19,915
Shut up.

1026
01:27:21,916 --> 01:27:23,040
Move.

1027
01:27:23,125 --> 01:27:24,582
What happened?

1028
01:27:25,291 --> 01:27:26,790
What happened, Chanda?

1029
01:27:26,875 --> 01:27:29,082
Tell me.
- What happened? Chanda..

1030
01:27:29,166 --> 01:27:30,544
He went inside..
What happened?

1031
01:27:30,545 --> 01:27:31,707
- Chunni. 
- Just a moment.

1032
01:27:31,791 --> 01:27:34,124
Don't bring him back or I'll fall in love.

1033
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:36,874
Chunni.
- I think I'm already falling for him.

1034
01:27:36,958 --> 01:27:39,040
What?

1035
01:27:40,458 --> 01:27:42,124
Chunni.
- Coming. Coming.

1036
01:28:05,583 --> 01:28:09,040
Why do they let drunkards enter the bus in the first place?

1037
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:10,790
Sir, ticket.

1038
01:28:13,791 --> 01:28:15,582
You are so young.

1039
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,624
You booze, get into fights.

1040
01:28:18,875 --> 01:28:20,665
Don't your parents object?

1041
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:21,999
Ticket.

1042
01:28:22,875 --> 01:28:27,999
If I had a son like you, I would
have thrashed him black my blue.

1043
01:28:28,708 --> 01:28:30,832
I would have knocked some sense into him.

1044
01:28:32,166 --> 01:28:34,124
What are you staring at?

1045
01:28:34,291 --> 01:28:36,124
Haven't you ever seen a woman before?

1046
01:28:36,125 --> 01:28:36,582
- Here.

1047
01:28:43,958 --> 01:28:46,665
Madam, ticket.
- He just ate it.

1048
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:48,999
What?
- He just ate it.

1049
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:52,290
I got it.

1050
01:28:53,208 --> 01:28:56,707
Go to the showroom and select the colour you like.

1051
01:28:57,333 --> 01:28:58,499
Thank you.

1052
01:29:00,291 --> 01:29:01,499
Are you okay?

1053
01:29:02,625 --> 01:29:03,749
I'm fine.

1054
01:29:04,541 --> 01:29:08,457
When you have time, do come and meet us, son.

1055
01:29:08,541 --> 01:29:10,165
Let me talk to him.

1056
01:29:10,541 --> 01:29:11,957
I'm keeping the phone down.

1057
01:29:13,458 --> 01:29:14,749
He hung up.

1058
01:29:16,625 --> 01:29:18,999
Why didn't you tell him you're sick?

1059
01:29:19,333 --> 01:29:21,415
On top of that, you bought him a new car.

1060
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:23,312
It's okay. 
He is young.

1061
01:29:23,313 --> 01:29:24,415
Let him be..

1062
01:29:25,625 --> 01:29:28,499
You're needlessly spoiling him.

1063
01:29:28,583 --> 01:29:30,544
You spoilt him when he was a kid.

1064
01:29:30,545 --> 01:29:31,582
Let me do it now.

1065
01:29:35,625 --> 01:29:36,999
What's wrong with him?

1066
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:54,624
Hello.

1067
01:29:54,708 --> 01:29:56,124
I want to speak to Paro.

1068
01:29:59,541 --> 01:30:02,249
Dev. 
It's 11 at night.

1069
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:03,832
This is important.

1070
01:30:03,916 --> 01:30:06,332
She's sleeping, Dev.
- Wake her up.

1071
01:30:06,708 --> 01:30:10,415
Dev, I need to speak to
you too.. about Rasika.

1072
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,999
Should I speak to you or your dad?

1073
01:30:15,708 --> 01:30:17,207
I'll call later.

1074
01:30:49,875 --> 01:30:52,790
"These eyes crave.."

1075
01:30:52,875 --> 01:30:58,874
"These eyes crave..
horizons unseen."

1076
01:30:58,958 --> 01:31:04,582
"These eyes crave.."

1077
01:31:04,958 --> 01:31:10,832
"These eyes crave.. from both, a stream passes."

1078
01:31:10,916 --> 01:31:14,415
"These eyes crave.."

1079
01:31:16,166 --> 01:31:20,582
"For paths long lost..
these eyes crave."

1080
01:31:20,666 --> 01:31:27,790
"These eyes crave.."

1081
01:31:27,875 --> 01:31:33,624
"Lost my way, I've lost my way.."

1082
01:32:01,208 --> 01:32:02,415
Hello.

1083
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:03,749
Dev.

1084
01:32:03,958 --> 01:32:04,999
Yes.

1085
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:07,999
Dev.
- Yes.

1086
01:32:08,083 --> 01:32:09,332
What do you want?

1087
01:32:10,875 --> 01:32:12,124
I want to meet you.

1088
01:32:12,583 --> 01:32:14,499
Are you in Delhi?
- Yes.

1089
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,249
Where are you?

1090
01:32:49,625 --> 01:32:50,790
Yes?

1091
01:32:50,875 --> 01:32:52,249
Open the door.

1092
01:33:05,708 --> 01:33:06,999
What's that?

1093
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:11,999
You were drinking?

1094
01:33:20,125 --> 01:33:22,040
This place is such a dump.

1095
01:33:26,958 --> 01:33:28,499
When did you last take a shower?

1096
01:33:32,333 --> 01:33:34,290
Paro, I love you.

1097
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:38,540
You're stinking.

1098
01:33:38,833 --> 01:33:41,290
Go take a shower.
Then we'll talk.

1099
01:33:45,125 --> 01:33:46,582
I made a mistake.

1100
01:33:47,541 --> 01:33:49,957
Go take a shower first. Go.

1101
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:02,808
What a filthy towel.

1102
01:34:02,809 --> 01:34:05,249
I'll ask for a fresh one.

1103
01:34:09,458 --> 01:34:10,999
Don't you have housekeeping?

1104
01:34:11,041 --> 01:34:13,499
Ma'am, he never leaves his keys at the reception.

1105
01:34:13,666 --> 01:34:15,999
Or else he just says 'later'.

1106
01:34:29,041 --> 01:34:30,057
Madam, bed-sheet.

1107
01:34:30,058 --> 01:34:31,790
- Take these. 
- Yes, madam.

1108
01:34:31,958 --> 01:34:33,915
And bring a carton.
- Yes, madam.

1109
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,999
And take all the other bottles.
- Yes, yes.

1110
01:34:38,666 --> 01:34:39,199
What's this?

1111
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:40,665
- It's cream.
Yes, that's fine.

1112
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:42,415
Wait. Stay here.

1113
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:44,300
The washing powder is green.

1114
01:34:44,301 --> 01:34:46,165
Only this one item is blue.

1115
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:48,332
Anything else?
- Nothing else.

1116
01:34:50,666 --> 01:34:51,915
Take this.

1117
01:34:54,416 --> 01:34:56,124
The clothes haven't been washed for long.

1118
01:34:56,375 --> 01:34:58,665
How can you be so dirty?

1119
01:35:13,416 --> 01:35:17,915
Paro.

1120
01:35:18,583 --> 01:35:19,749
Yes?

1121
01:35:30,625 --> 01:35:32,249
I love you, Paro.

1122
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,749
Rasika told me everything.

1123
01:35:36,208 --> 01:35:38,874
She's lying.
- I know everything.

1124
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:41,040
I'm happy, I got married.

1125
01:35:41,125 --> 01:35:44,624
Or I would've had to wait for you endlessly.

1126
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:49,332
Are you happy?
- Yes.

1127
01:35:50,083 --> 01:35:51,624
Mr. Bhuvan is a gentleman.

1128
01:35:52,083 --> 01:35:53,374
Mr. Bhuvan?

1129
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:56,540
Had I married you, I would have called you Mr. Dev.

1130
01:35:56,791 --> 01:35:58,790
Let them soak for a while.

1131
01:36:12,250 --> 01:36:13,332
So..

1132
01:36:15,291 --> 01:36:16,874
I guess you make love to him.

1133
01:36:18,625 --> 01:36:19,731
What do you want?

1134
01:36:19,732 --> 01:36:21,749
- I told you that I love you.

1135
01:36:22,875 --> 01:36:24,290
What do you want?

1136
01:36:29,625 --> 01:36:31,332
I want to love you.

1137
01:36:33,250 --> 01:36:36,540
What do you mean by 'want to love'?

1138
01:36:36,916 --> 01:36:38,207
Make love to me.

1139
01:36:47,916 --> 01:36:49,082
What now?

1140
01:36:49,708 --> 01:36:52,999
Do what you want to, but I'm not taking my clothes off.

1141
01:37:04,583 --> 01:37:05,707
Paro..

1142
01:37:59,708 --> 01:38:01,332
When will you meet me, next time?

1143
01:38:09,833 --> 01:38:11,540
Next time, you want to talk, call me in the day.

1144
01:38:12,083 --> 01:38:13,832
Are you really happy?

1145
01:38:13,833 --> 01:38:15,665
He has two children.

1146
01:38:15,916 --> 01:38:16,908
Lovely children.

1147
01:38:16,909 --> 01:38:18,457
And they love me a lot.

1148
01:38:19,125 --> 01:38:20,431
You don't love me.

1149
01:38:20,432 --> 01:38:23,332
You can't love anyone except yourself.

1150
01:38:23,583 --> 01:38:26,665
You should marry either this mirror or the one in the toilet.

1151
01:38:26,916 --> 01:38:29,332
Don't feed me that psychological nonsense, okay?

1152
01:38:33,166 --> 01:38:34,832
Never take so much of drugs.

1153
01:38:35,125 --> 01:38:38,499
Some things look too good, the rest too bad.

1154
01:38:45,583 --> 01:38:48,332
I'm leaving. Get over me..

1155
01:38:48,666 --> 01:38:50,707
..and go back home, get a life.

1156
01:38:52,083 --> 01:38:54,040
Why don't you go home to your old man?

1157
01:38:55,333 --> 01:38:58,165
He might be old, but he's quite good in bed.

1158
01:38:59,458 --> 01:39:00,749
Then what are you doing here?

1159
01:39:00,958 --> 01:39:02,957
Go ride your superman.

1160
01:39:03,166 --> 01:39:05,457
I don't need to ride him.

1161
01:39:08,875 --> 01:39:10,332
You are humiliating me?

1162
01:39:11,458 --> 01:39:15,207
No, I am showing you what you really are.

1163
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:24,207
Get out.

1164
01:39:27,541 --> 01:39:30,582
"It's raining now."

1165
01:39:30,666 --> 01:39:36,582
"It's raining now, a fevered shower."

1166
01:39:36,666 --> 01:39:42,582
"It's raining now."

1167
01:39:42,666 --> 01:39:48,624
"It's raining now, little jabs that scar."

1168
01:39:48,708 --> 01:39:52,415
"It's raining now.."

1169
01:39:53,875 --> 01:39:58,332
"The song's a wail, its raining now."

1170
01:39:58,416 --> 01:40:05,457
"Its raining now."

1171
01:40:05,541 --> 01:40:14,790
"Lost my way, I've lost my way.."

1172
01:41:18,708 --> 01:41:23,082
"The devil takes your beauty, the devil takes your love."

1173
01:41:23,166 --> 01:41:27,582
"The devil takes your emotional torture from above."

1174
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:32,124
"The devil takes your beauty, the devil takes your love."

1175
01:41:32,208 --> 01:41:36,749
"The devil takes your emotional torture from above."

1176
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:41,165
"The devil takes your beauty, the devil takes your love."

1177
01:41:41,250 --> 01:41:45,832
"The devil takes your emotional torture from above."

1178
01:41:45,916 --> 01:41:50,249
"The devil takes your beauty, the devil takes your love."

1179
01:41:50,333 --> 01:41:53,124
"Devil takes your love."

1180
01:41:54,416 --> 01:41:55,707
What's wrong?

1181
01:41:59,791 --> 01:42:01,249
Will you say something?

1182
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:08,790
What are you?
Florence Nightingale tonight?

1183
01:42:18,125 --> 01:42:20,290
Your Romeo is so trashed.

1184
01:42:20,833 --> 01:42:23,290
He threw his wallet at me.

1185
01:42:24,291 --> 01:42:25,957
Don't let him go.

1186
01:42:26,166 --> 01:42:27,331
Keep him with you.

1187
01:42:27,332 --> 01:42:29,790
Keep him with you for 1 0-1 5 days..

1188
01:42:29,875 --> 01:42:32,457
..while I max out his wallet.

1189
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,665
I witnessed the climax to his love story.

1190
01:42:41,458 --> 01:42:43,415
A lot of violence.

1191
01:42:46,541 --> 01:42:48,707
Give me his wallet.
- Why?

1192
01:42:48,916 --> 01:42:50,124
Give me his wallet.

1193
01:42:51,416 --> 01:42:53,165
Hope you are not falling for him.

1194
01:42:53,458 --> 01:42:56,040
You'll get your money, give me his wallet.

1195
01:42:56,958 --> 01:42:58,415
Have you lost it?

1196
01:42:58,791 --> 01:43:00,124
Shut up, broker.

1197
01:43:01,333 --> 01:43:02,707
His wallet.

1198
01:43:12,791 --> 01:43:14,165
You need to talk.

1199
01:43:23,125 --> 01:43:25,290
When you feel pain, you should talk.

1200
01:43:38,041 --> 01:43:39,707
What do you know about pain?

1201
01:44:34,125 --> 01:44:35,665
Did you sleep well?

1202
01:44:38,041 --> 01:44:39,165
Yes.

1203
01:44:40,583 --> 01:44:42,832
There's some coffee in the coffee-machine.

1204
01:44:55,750 --> 01:44:58,457
What's your story?
- Story?

1205
01:45:00,625 --> 01:45:02,717
I mean.. 
how did you become..

1206
01:45:02,718 --> 01:45:03,582
you know..

1207
01:45:04,375 --> 01:45:05,707
How I became a strumpet?

1208
01:45:06,291 --> 01:45:08,665
No.. - Call girl? Escort?

1209
01:45:09,458 --> 01:45:10,957
Flesh trader.

1210
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,649
I've a client. 
The NGO type.

1211
01:45:13,650 --> 01:45:15,690
He has trouble calling me a 'strumpet'.

1212
01:45:16,375 --> 01:45:19,415
So, he calls me C.S.W.
Commercial Sex Worker.

1213
01:45:19,541 --> 01:45:21,874
It's out of fashion to say 'strumpet.'

1214
01:45:24,375 --> 01:45:26,749
She's right.
- How's she right?

1215
01:45:26,833 --> 01:45:28,416
You don't love her.

1216
01:45:28,417 --> 01:45:29,915
- I do love her.

1217
01:45:30,250 --> 01:45:32,124
If you really, really loved her, you would've been with her.

1218
01:45:32,208 --> 01:45:34,790
First, you made a mistake and
when you realised your mistake..

1219
01:45:35,041 --> 01:45:36,374
..you should've apologised.

1220
01:45:36,458 --> 01:45:37,842
But how can you do that?

1221
01:45:37,843 --> 01:45:38,707
Big male ego.

1222
01:45:38,791 --> 01:45:41,582
You didn't ask her even once not to get married.

1223
01:45:44,375 --> 01:45:46,249
Why should I shut up?

1224
01:45:48,166 --> 01:45:50,040
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.

1225
01:45:50,416 --> 01:45:51,920
You can't love anyone.

1226
01:45:51,921 --> 01:45:53,082
Just accept it.

1227
01:45:54,625 --> 01:45:55,545
It's men's toilet.

1228
01:45:55,546 --> 01:45:56,874
Do you mind getting out?

1229
01:45:57,083 --> 01:45:59,624
Ever since I accepted what I am, I have been okay.

1230
01:46:00,583 --> 01:46:01,999
You're okay?

1231
01:46:02,291 --> 01:46:03,999
You think I'm not?

1232
01:46:04,083 --> 01:46:06,332
You like to believe that I'm hiding a lot of pain.

1233
01:46:08,166 --> 01:46:10,415
Are you not?
- Not anymore.

1234
01:46:11,625 --> 01:46:13,624
Liar. - Okay.

1235
01:46:13,708 --> 01:46:14,999
What's okay?

1236
01:46:16,375 --> 01:46:18,582
Whatever you say.
You're the boss.

1237
01:46:19,416 --> 01:46:21,082
Why are you all 'happy and glee'?

1238
01:46:21,916 --> 01:46:23,999
What should I do then?

1239
01:46:26,416 --> 01:46:29,207
Whatever, just don't irritate me.

1240
01:46:30,875 --> 01:46:31,957
Idiot.

1241
01:46:32,083 --> 01:46:34,540
I heard that.
- Thank you.

1242
01:46:35,875 --> 01:46:37,771
Why are you justifying her?

1243
01:46:37,772 --> 01:46:39,457
- Because she's right.

1244
01:46:39,541 --> 01:46:40,874
What's so right about what she said?

1245
01:46:40,958 --> 01:46:43,040
She's happy. She has moved on.

1246
01:46:43,375 --> 01:46:46,124
I like that word, you know..
'moved on.'

1247
01:46:46,583 --> 01:46:47,665
It's so easy.

1248
01:46:47,750 --> 01:46:49,099
People do move on.

1249
01:46:49,100 --> 01:46:50,374
I've done that.

1250
01:46:50,458 --> 01:46:52,249
Yes. To coke.

1251
01:46:52,333 --> 01:46:54,866
That's your solution to everything.

1252
01:46:54,867 --> 01:46:55,499
Is it?

1253
01:46:58,125 --> 01:46:59,415
Goodnight.

1254
01:47:33,250 --> 01:47:35,410
Stop it.
Why are you filming me?

1255
01:47:35,411 --> 01:47:35,999
Go away.

1256
01:47:51,041 --> 01:47:53,249
Did you get off on it, you sick man.

1257
01:47:53,333 --> 01:47:54,075
Just shut up.

1258
01:47:54,076 --> 01:47:55,957
- Let's kill her and burry her.

1259
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,021
Mom, I know you're there.

1260
01:47:57,022 --> 01:47:58,124
Please pick up the phone.

1261
01:47:58,208 --> 01:48:01,415
Come on, hit me. You coward.

1262
01:48:02,125 --> 01:48:03,499
They would stare at me as if..

1263
01:48:03,583 --> 01:48:05,624
..I was some kind of a serial killer.

1264
01:48:05,833 --> 01:48:07,707
No one spoke to me.

1265
01:48:08,625 --> 01:48:11,374
How is it my fault if the whole world saw me doing it?

1266
01:48:11,750 --> 01:48:13,999
And how did they know it was me?

1267
01:48:14,750 --> 01:48:16,999
They didn't show the MMS on TV..

1268
01:48:18,541 --> 01:48:20,832
..nor was my photograph published anywhere.

1269
01:48:22,041 --> 01:48:24,082
They all downloaded it.

1270
01:48:24,166 --> 01:48:25,790
They enjoyed it.

1271
01:48:26,583 --> 01:48:28,624
Half the country got off on that clip..

1272
01:48:29,125 --> 01:48:31,290
Then they turned around and called me the 'strumpet.'

1273
01:48:36,583 --> 01:48:38,907
I want to get smashed tonight.

1274
01:48:38,908 --> 01:48:39,957
Let's go out.

1275
01:48:42,291 --> 01:48:43,707
I've to pick up my car too.

1276
01:48:45,708 --> 01:48:49,874
"My heart desires.."

1277
01:48:49,958 --> 01:48:53,707
"To drown in dreams."

1278
01:48:53,791 --> 01:49:01,624
"Fill up my arms with sky, clouds, streams."

1279
01:49:01,708 --> 01:49:05,707
"A rhythm holds my breath aloft."

1280
01:49:05,875 --> 01:49:10,499
"A song that's whispered so soft."

1281
01:49:10,708 --> 01:49:14,749
"Everything's a sweet haze."

1282
01:49:14,833 --> 01:49:22,348
"I seem to own the world these days.

1283
01:49:22,349 --> 01:49:26,207
I seem to own it."

1284
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:28,707
Come on.
Come on.

1285
01:49:57,166 --> 01:50:01,332
"The bee buzzes between flowers."

1286
01:50:01,416 --> 01:50:03,332
"Humming songs of summer showers."

1287
01:50:03,416 --> 01:50:05,290
"Sometimes that way, sometimes this.."

1288
01:50:05,375 --> 01:50:07,290
"The world's a swirl of coloured bliss."

1289
01:50:07,375 --> 01:50:10,957
"Drenched is this open sky."

1290
01:50:11,375 --> 01:50:15,415
"Bathed in its colours will I.."

1291
01:50:15,625 --> 01:50:18,790
"..hum a tune of happiness."

1292
01:50:18,875 --> 01:50:23,499
"The breeze blows in little laughs."

1293
01:50:23,708 --> 01:50:28,624
"Hugs the seasons, kisses each draft."

1294
01:50:28,708 --> 01:50:30,665
Instead of holding me like a father would..

1295
01:50:32,583 --> 01:50:37,457
..and telling me, 'It's okay, my baby."

1296
01:50:37,708 --> 01:50:38,668
"Forget the past.

1297
01:50:38,669 --> 01:50:40,249
Forget whatever happened."

1298
01:50:44,416 --> 01:50:46,457
He shot himself.

1299
01:50:52,750 --> 01:50:57,165
Look at me.
- What?

1300
01:51:00,708 --> 01:51:04,999
Come here.

1301
01:51:08,333 --> 01:51:11,391
It's okay, my baby.
Forget the past.

1302
01:51:11,392 --> 01:51:13,540
Forget whatever happened.

1303
01:51:24,208 --> 01:51:26,874
When I feel sad, I come here.

1304
01:51:27,166 --> 01:51:29,217
Steaming momos (Chinese food), sir.

1305
01:51:29,218 --> 01:51:29,957
- Thank you.

1306
01:51:33,083 --> 01:51:35,124
How much? 
- Rs.60 only.

1307
01:51:37,333 --> 01:51:41,540
Take it. No. 
Keep the change.

1308
01:51:43,583 --> 01:51:45,249
Thank you. 
- You're welcome.

1309
01:51:51,208 --> 01:51:52,290
Hot..

1310
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:56,374
Paro is very beautiful?
- Yes.

1311
01:51:58,750 --> 01:52:00,249
I love her to death.

1312
01:52:05,833 --> 01:52:06,957
Still?

1313
01:52:08,125 --> 01:52:09,415
Forever.

1314
01:52:21,625 --> 01:52:23,499
Chanda, I love you too.

1315
01:52:28,250 --> 01:52:29,874
You're such a jerk.

1316
01:52:36,791 --> 01:52:39,957
"Anklets.."

1317
01:52:41,541 --> 01:52:43,374
Sleep more if you want to.

1318
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,832
Where are you going?
- To college.

1319
01:52:49,541 --> 01:52:51,624
Bye.
- Bye.

1320
01:52:54,541 --> 01:52:57,582
Will I see you when I get back?
- Yes.

1321
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,624
Do you know something?
- What?

1322
01:53:08,708 --> 01:53:10,256
You're not so bad.

1323
01:53:10,257 --> 01:53:11,374
I love you.

1324
01:53:20,083 --> 01:53:21,915
I love you, Chanda.

1325
01:53:23,375 --> 01:53:25,749
Chanda.
I love you.

1326
01:53:25,833 --> 01:53:31,582
"Its stubborn pleas ring a restless beat."

1327
01:53:31,791 --> 01:53:36,874
"My anklets plead for a sight of him."

1328
01:53:36,958 --> 01:53:39,249
Her name is Paro.
- I know.

1329
01:53:40,208 --> 01:53:41,624
He's crazy about her.

1330
01:53:41,708 --> 01:53:42,808
He doesn't care for you.

1331
01:53:42,809 --> 01:53:43,999
He just sleeps with you.

1332
01:53:46,250 --> 01:53:47,999
Why are you doing this to my business?

1333
01:53:48,541 --> 01:53:55,915
"Haunting me by night and day.."

1334
01:53:56,041 --> 01:54:12,874
"Lead me dancing to my lover's drums."

1335
01:54:36,166 --> 01:54:38,040
Hello. - Sir.

1336
01:54:39,166 --> 01:54:41,374
When a woman discovers the witch in her..

1337
01:54:42,708 --> 01:54:46,582
..then she is not worth bringing home..
to your heart..

1338
01:54:47,208 --> 01:54:48,192
What do you mean?

1339
01:54:48,193 --> 01:54:49,582
- Remember I told you?

1340
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:51,214
This is Delhi.

1341
01:54:51,215 --> 01:54:53,457
Here you can enjoy a girl, relish a girl..

1342
01:54:54,708 --> 01:54:55,999
..but never keep one.

1343
01:54:57,375 --> 01:54:59,540
You end up paying very dearly.

1344
01:55:08,541 --> 01:55:09,999
Chanda.

1345
01:55:10,250 --> 01:55:11,457
She's out.

1346
01:55:12,375 --> 01:55:13,874
She'll be back after noon.

1347
01:55:14,958 --> 01:55:16,165
It is afternoon.

1348
01:55:18,041 --> 01:55:18,778
Who are you?

1349
01:55:18,779 --> 01:55:21,540
- I spoke to you.
You asked me for a photo.

1350
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:30,374
By what time will she be back?

1351
01:55:34,125 --> 01:55:36,207
Do you get protection here?

1352
01:55:37,208 --> 01:55:39,957
By the way, my medical certificate is also quite clear.

1353
01:55:50,875 --> 01:55:52,082
Chanda.

1354
01:55:54,125 --> 01:55:59,457
"It's all burnt down to ash."

1355
01:56:03,750 --> 01:56:10,290
"To dust this life's been dashed."

1356
01:56:12,625 --> 01:56:27,707
"Where have those little smiles gone?"

1357
01:56:51,166 --> 01:56:56,207
"These sighs are charred, this breath is smoke."

1358
01:56:56,291 --> 01:57:00,749
"Charred.. charred.."

1359
01:57:00,833 --> 01:57:05,790
"Can't revive a hope that's choked.."

1360
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:10,165
"Charred.. charred.."

1361
01:57:10,375 --> 01:57:20,165
"The night's a coiled snake, its fangs drawn.."

1362
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:33,232
Please come, sir. Welcome.
Welcome.

1363
01:57:33,233 --> 01:57:33,915
- Sir.

1364
01:57:35,458 --> 01:57:36,874
Cheers.

1365
01:57:37,166 --> 01:57:38,540
This is for your girl.

1366
01:57:42,916 --> 01:57:44,207
And what is this for?

1367
01:57:46,625 --> 01:57:48,540
Sir, you left your room open?

1368
01:57:48,875 --> 01:57:50,124
Your box..

1369
01:58:14,541 --> 01:59:45,124
"Where have those little smiles gone?"

'Seven people were mercilessly mowed down..'

1391
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:06,207
'..by a BMW reportedly been driven by Devendra Singh..'

1392
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:26,082
Drunk driving, road rage as well as a rich boy with toys..

1393
02:00:26,166 --> 02:00:29,165
Do you think this is going to be an other incident?

1394
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:33,124
It could possibly be that the father was very rich..

1395
02:00:34,458 --> 02:00:37,874
Last night, a black BMW maimed
seven people on Tilak Bridge.

1396
02:00:37,958 --> 02:00:39,957
Everyone died on the spot.

1397
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,999
The BMW was located in the Paharganj area of Delhi.

1398
02:00:43,041 --> 02:00:46,665
The BMW is registered to famous businessman of..

1399
02:00:46,750 --> 02:00:48,165
..Punjab Mr. Satpal Singh.

1400
02:00:51,750 --> 02:00:53,124
What do you remember?

1401
02:00:56,250 --> 02:00:57,624
Sattu.

1402
02:00:58,083 --> 02:01:00,957
Read your statement and sign it.

1403
02:01:01,875 --> 02:01:03,790
We'll discuss everything else on the way.

1404
02:01:14,541 --> 02:01:16,624
Now, listen to what I'm about to say.

1405
02:01:19,333 --> 02:01:21,874
You need to understand something very clearly.

1406
02:01:21,958 --> 02:01:24,857
Can we make a stop on the way?

1407
02:01:24,858 --> 02:01:26,540
I have some work.

1408
02:01:27,500 --> 02:01:28,957
What work?

1409
02:01:29,625 --> 02:01:31,790
I want to tell my friend that I am fine.

1410
02:01:36,291 --> 02:01:37,999
He doesn't carry a phone.

1411
02:01:42,375 --> 02:01:43,874
Make it quick.

1412
02:01:59,750 --> 02:02:00,915
Chunni?

1413
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:02,457
Who's this?

1414
02:02:03,583 --> 02:02:05,104
Chunni.
- What are you doing here?

1415
02:02:05,105 --> 02:02:05,582
Go inside.

1416
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:07,665
What are you doing here?

1417
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:08,896
Don't come here again.

1418
02:02:08,897 --> 02:02:09,832
I don't want trouble.

1419
02:02:09,916 --> 02:02:11,202
Just need a gram.

1420
02:02:11,203 --> 02:02:12,790
I'll pay you later.

1421
02:02:14,333 --> 02:02:15,499
Wait here.

1422
02:02:20,208 --> 02:02:21,374
Here.

1423
02:02:21,750 --> 02:02:22,436
Thank you, pal.

1424
02:02:22,437 --> 02:02:23,624
- Don't come back again.

1425
02:02:24,208 --> 02:02:26,457
I don't want the money.
Your job is done.

1426
02:02:29,083 --> 02:02:29,947
Now, go.

1427
02:02:29,948 --> 02:02:31,999
Your job is done.

1428
02:02:35,875 --> 02:02:37,499
This is your medical report.

1429
02:02:41,500 --> 02:02:43,957
The court can cancel your bail any time..

1430
02:02:45,125 --> 02:02:47,499
..but because of your father's death
there is a lot of sympathy for you.

1431
02:02:47,583 --> 02:02:48,999
The press feels sorry for you..

1432
02:02:49,083 --> 02:02:50,749
..doesn't mean you take advantage of it.

1433
02:02:51,208 --> 02:02:53,332
You're allowed to leave the city only for four days..

1434
02:02:54,416 --> 02:02:56,999
..and be back after his funeral.

1435
02:02:57,125 --> 02:02:58,999
Thereafter you cannot leave Delhi.

1436
02:03:02,333 --> 02:03:04,749
And yes, you will have to visit the
police station every morning..

1437
02:03:04,833 --> 02:03:06,249
..to sign the register.

1438
02:03:06,583 --> 02:03:08,650
I've stood as your guarantor in the court.

1439
02:03:08,651 --> 02:03:09,707
Do you understand me?

1440
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,249
Listen. Dev.

1441
02:03:56,041 --> 02:03:58,249
Mother. Dev.

1442
02:04:36,416 --> 02:04:39,499
Why did you do it? 
Why?

1443
02:05:21,750 --> 02:05:23,499
You were such a nice kid.

1444
02:05:23,583 --> 02:05:25,582
Why are you doing it to yourself?

1445
02:05:25,666 --> 02:05:27,290
You have everything.

1446
02:05:29,625 --> 02:05:33,332
I hope he rots in jail.

1447
02:05:43,166 --> 02:05:47,457
Here. 
Money for the lawyer.

1448
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:50,332
And for me?

1449
02:05:52,375 --> 02:05:53,999
You can take him please..

1450
02:06:06,041 --> 02:06:07,364
'You don't love me.

1451
02:06:07,365 --> 02:06:10,290
You can't love anybody except yourself.'

1452
02:06:10,458 --> 02:06:12,207
'Go ruin someone else's life.'

1453
02:06:12,541 --> 02:06:15,040
'Anyway, you're not worthy enough to get married to me.'

1454
02:06:15,625 --> 02:06:17,165
Are you humiliating me?

1455
02:06:17,375 --> 02:06:19,290
'I'm showing you what you really are.'

1456
02:06:27,583 --> 02:06:31,011
'You know what?
You are not so bad.

1457
02:06:31,012 --> 02:06:32,249
I love you.'

1458
02:06:40,750 --> 02:06:42,366
What's your name, sir?

1459
02:06:42,367 --> 02:06:44,790
- My name is Satpal Singh, sir.

1460
02:06:48,458 --> 02:06:50,415
Do you drink, Satpal Singh sir?

1461
02:06:51,166 --> 02:06:52,624
Like a fish.

1462
02:06:55,250 --> 02:06:56,832
Then let's do one thing.

1463
02:06:57,416 --> 02:06:59,915
Why don't we skip Delhi and go on a tour?

1464
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,439
Let's drink in solitude.

1465
02:07:02,440 --> 02:07:05,082
I'll pay for everything.

1466
02:07:05,958 --> 02:07:08,499
But why?
- Just like that.

1467
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:40,749
"This world's so round."

1468
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:46,082
"What's up, comes down."

1469
02:07:52,750 --> 02:07:54,457
Sir, try this out.

1470
02:07:55,625 --> 02:07:58,499
What's this? 
- Have it.

1471
02:07:58,500 --> 02:08:01,249
Pure village opium..

1472
02:08:01,333 --> 02:08:03,290
"You're a fortune now, next week you're crap."

1473
02:08:03,375 --> 02:08:05,332
"Free this minute, the next you're trapped."

1474
02:08:05,416 --> 02:08:07,249
"Come watch the show.."

1475
02:08:07,333 --> 02:08:08,999
"Yes, yes, yes.."

1476
02:08:09,041 --> 02:08:16,915
"This world's so round."

1477
02:08:17,083 --> 02:08:24,207
"What's up, comes down."

1478
02:08:49,041 --> 02:08:51,165
"Loopy, loopy, sideways skewed."

1479
02:08:51,250 --> 02:08:53,290
"Sugary, spicy, both ways messed."

1480
02:08:53,375 --> 02:08:55,290
"The real is unreal, a real fake.."

1481
02:08:55,375 --> 02:08:57,249
"Yes, yes, yes.."

1482
02:08:57,333 --> 02:08:59,290
"It comes and goes, dip by dip."

1483
02:08:59,375 --> 02:09:01,290
"Hide and seek, finger on lip."

1484
02:09:01,375 --> 02:09:03,207
"Boils, bubbles, hid behind.."

1485
02:09:03,291 --> 02:09:05,040
"Yes, yes, yes.."

1486
02:09:05,125 --> 02:09:12,874
"This world's so round."

1487
02:09:13,041 --> 02:09:18,124
"What's up, comes down."

1488
02:09:23,041 --> 02:09:25,082
Stop.. stop..

1489
02:09:38,833 --> 02:09:40,290
What happened, sir?

1490
02:09:42,500 --> 02:09:43,706
Have some water.

1491
02:09:43,707 --> 02:09:45,290
You'll feel better.

1492
02:09:47,208 --> 02:09:48,957
Keep this money, pal.

1493
02:09:50,958 --> 02:09:52,707
Take me back to Delhi.

1494
02:09:52,791 --> 02:09:54,790
"It tempts, pleases.."

1495
02:09:54,875 --> 02:09:57,384
"Then cheats and teases.

1496
02:09:57,385 --> 02:10:00,624
Smacks our faces in the mud."

1497
02:10:00,833 --> 02:10:02,790
"Sings a lullaby."

1498
02:10:02,875 --> 02:10:04,749
"Then screams out high."

1499
02:10:04,833 --> 02:10:08,915
"Grinds our faces in the mud."

1500
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:12,915
"No bump, no jolt along the way."

1501
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:17,040
"Without warning it all gives way."

1502
02:10:17,125 --> 02:10:24,999
"Yes, yes.."

1503
02:10:25,041 --> 02:10:26,317
You are dropping me to Delhi, aren't you?

1504
02:10:26,318 --> 02:10:27,290
- "Every corner,
every street."

1505
02:10:27,375 --> 02:10:29,332
"This way, that way, hands and feet."

1506
02:10:29,416 --> 02:10:31,290
"God, help us.."

1507
02:10:31,375 --> 02:10:33,249
"Yes, yes, yes.."

1508
02:10:33,333 --> 02:10:35,249
"You're a fortune now, next week you're crap."

1509
02:10:35,333 --> 02:10:37,290
"Free this minute, the next you're trapped."

1510
02:10:37,375 --> 02:10:39,290
"Come watch the show.."

1511
02:10:39,375 --> 02:10:40,999
"Yes, yes, yes.."
- Keep this money.

1512
02:10:41,333 --> 02:10:43,369
Sir, are you all right?

1513
02:10:43,370 --> 02:10:44,874
- Yes, I'm fine

1514
02:10:45,500 --> 02:10:47,499
I'm sorry. 
Hello.

1515
02:10:59,875 --> 02:11:01,707
Is Paro very beautiful?

1516
02:11:02,666 --> 02:11:03,832
Yes.

1517
02:11:05,541 --> 02:11:07,332
I love her to death.

1518
02:11:07,708 --> 02:11:10,999
Still?
- Forever.

1519
02:11:19,583 --> 02:11:23,374
Here's your bill.
You too take it.

1520
02:11:23,458 --> 02:11:24,957
What happened?
- Give the money.

1521
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:26,582
It's time to close the bar.

1522
02:11:26,666 --> 02:11:28,040
Can I get another drink?

1523
02:11:28,125 --> 02:11:30,457
Not any more. 
Please, leave.

1524
02:11:30,458 --> 02:11:31,207
- Okay.

1525
02:11:31,833 --> 02:11:33,540
200.. 300..

1526
02:11:37,833 --> 02:11:38,999
Keep this.

1527
02:11:52,958 --> 02:11:53,614
What happened?

1528
02:11:53,615 --> 02:11:54,832
Looking for your wallet?

1529
02:11:59,208 --> 02:12:01,457
No.
- Someone must've picked your pocket.

1530
02:12:03,500 --> 02:12:04,999
Check his bag.
- Yes.

1531
02:12:13,041 --> 02:12:13,935
There's nothing.

1532
02:12:13,936 --> 02:12:15,332
- Give it to me. 
- See.

1533
02:12:19,208 --> 02:12:21,832
It's expensive.
- Doesn't look like one.

1534
02:12:24,416 --> 02:12:25,665
Show me the jacket.

1535
02:12:27,166 --> 02:12:29,415
Check it.
- Yes.

1536
02:12:31,208 --> 02:12:33,040
Nothing in this too.

1537
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,915
You can get your money by selling them.

1538
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,707
No, it still won't cover.

1539
02:12:44,958 --> 02:12:47,332
Throw him out.

1540
02:12:47,708 --> 02:12:50,082
Come on, get up.

1541
02:12:52,541 --> 02:12:54,082
Come on. Get up.

1542
02:12:58,583 --> 02:13:01,415
Out. Get lost.

1543
02:13:02,083 --> 02:13:03,665
Don't come here again.

1544
02:13:04,833 --> 02:13:05,999
Come on, get inside.

1545
02:13:27,958 --> 02:13:30,624
Hey. 
Do you have anything to drink?

1546
02:13:36,458 --> 02:13:37,957
What's your name?

1547
02:13:46,708 --> 02:13:49,749
Okay, then.. I'll call you Dwij.

1548
02:13:56,375 --> 02:13:57,540
Yours or mine?

1549
02:14:01,250 --> 02:14:02,915
Yes, hotel reception.

1550
02:14:03,458 --> 02:14:06,207
Hello.
- Dev?

1551
02:14:06,750 --> 02:14:10,540
Is Chanda there?
- She has left.

1552
02:14:48,958 --> 02:14:53,707
Open it. Take him out.

1553
02:14:55,250 --> 02:14:56,790
'You are lucky.'

1554
02:14:56,875 --> 02:14:58,499
'There's still time, straighten up or..'

1555
02:14:58,791 --> 02:15:02,040
'..you'll end up like that Tilak bridge guy.'

1556
02:15:21,750 --> 02:15:27,249
"This faint drumbeat in my heart awakes.."

1557
02:15:27,333 --> 02:15:29,082
"A tremor inside.."

1558
02:15:29,166 --> 02:15:32,832
"The fog-veil parts, the sun fires up."

1559
02:15:32,916 --> 02:15:47,540
"A tremor inside.."

1560
02:15:47,625 --> 02:15:52,749
"Throbs with life a tremor inside.."

1561
02:15:53,416 --> 02:16:00,207
"As far as the eye can see."

1562
02:16:00,791 --> 02:16:04,957
"An illusion of the truth maybe.."

1563
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:06,707
You must have got some photograph of hers?

1564
02:16:06,791 --> 02:16:08,249
Where did you meet her?

1565
02:16:08,750 --> 02:16:10,999
Must be some place she arrived from
when you found her at the station?

1566
02:16:11,958 --> 02:16:14,249
There must be some place she goes to.

1567
02:16:18,791 --> 02:16:20,832
Thank you, sir. Rs.20.

1568
02:16:21,416 --> 02:16:22,957
Hey. 
I'll go for a smoke.

1569
02:16:34,541 --> 02:16:35,749
Hello, sir.

1570
02:16:39,166 --> 02:16:41,332
Sir, do you remember me?

1571
02:16:42,250 --> 02:16:44,582
Steaming momos. 
Steaming momos?

1572
02:16:44,666 --> 02:16:48,249
"It makes you want to live again."

1573
02:16:48,333 --> 02:16:51,957
"A tremor inside.."

1574
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:56,082
"It enlivens death, the tremor inside.."

1575
02:16:56,208 --> 02:16:57,582
What are you looking at?

1576
02:16:57,916 --> 02:16:59,290
She'll come.

1577
02:17:00,083 --> 02:17:02,832
Meanwhile, serve these momos..

1578
02:17:04,083 --> 02:17:05,457
..in the rickshaw.

1579
02:17:06,791 --> 02:17:10,374
"A tremor inside.."

1580
02:17:10,458 --> 02:17:15,624
"Throbs with life a tremor inside.."

1581
02:17:16,250 --> 02:17:23,290
"Feel these moments."

1582
02:17:23,625 --> 02:17:30,207
"Touch these moments."

1583
02:17:30,291 --> 02:17:33,540
"These moments.."

1584
02:17:34,958 --> 02:17:36,124
Chanda..

1585
02:17:39,750 --> 02:17:41,582
I don't love Paro.

1586
02:17:48,333 --> 02:17:51,082
I never saw her for what she was.

1587
02:17:53,125 --> 02:17:54,374
You were right.

1588
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:57,415
I am a jerk.

1589
02:18:04,458 --> 02:18:06,290
When did you leave that place?

1590
02:18:07,791 --> 02:18:09,707
The same day you left me.

1591
02:18:10,166 --> 02:18:10,866
Why?

1592
02:18:10,867 --> 02:18:13,665
- You bought this for me, didn't you?

1593
02:18:20,666 --> 02:18:23,613
"Do something timeless this time."

1594
02:18:23,614 --> 02:18:24,624
- Let's go.

1595
02:18:24,708 --> 02:18:27,082
I told the Police Inspector that we'll be there by 12.

1596
02:18:27,333 --> 02:18:34,124
"Fill yourself with the light sublime."

1597
02:18:35,416 --> 02:18:41,790
"Light up a torch for your heart."

1598
02:19:07,083 --> 02:19:14,082
"As far as the eye can see."

1599
02:19:14,416 --> 02:19:19,648
"An illusion of the truth maybe..

1600
02:19:19,649 --> 02:19:23,957
Yes, it's true. 
It's true."

1601
02:19:49,666 --> 02:19:52,082
"My heart croons.."

1602
02:19:56,208 --> 02:20:00,207
"One, two, three, four, six."

1603
02:20:00,291 --> 02:20:02,790
"Could I melt this heart into a tune?"

1604
02:20:02,875 --> 02:20:04,999
"Get my heartbeat to croon."

1605
02:20:05,041 --> 02:20:08,999
"Am I smoking hot or what?

1606
02:20:09,291 --> 02:20:11,124
"In my chest is a fire."

1607
02:20:11,208 --> 02:20:13,374
"My desire's on a pyre."

1608
02:20:13,458 --> 02:20:17,540
"Darling, I don't know what to say."

1609
02:20:17,791 --> 02:20:20,040
"I saw dreams of heaven."

1610
02:20:20,125 --> 02:20:22,707
"But they all went to hell."

1611
02:20:26,833 --> 02:20:28,747
"It's all gone up in smoke.

1612
02:20:28,748 --> 02:20:30,874
To my world I bid farewell."

1613
02:20:30,958 --> 02:20:35,457
"God help whoever gets bitten by this bug."

1614
02:20:35,541 --> 02:20:39,790
"The devil takes your beauty, the devil takes your love."

1615
02:20:39,875 --> 02:20:44,374
"The devil takes your emotional torture from above."

1616
02:20:48,625 --> 02:20:52,957
"The devil takes your beauty, the devil takes your love."

1617
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:57,499
"The devil takes your emotional torture from above."

1618
02:20:59,458 --> 02:21:05,915
"Go away, oh, love."

1619
02:21:06,083 --> 02:21:10,374
"The devil takes your beauty, the devil takes your love."

1620
02:21:10,458 --> 02:21:15,165
"The devil takes your emotional torture from above."

1621
02:21:45,291 --> 02:21:49,374
"This heart is torn by a tragedy, tragedy."

1622
02:21:49,583 --> 02:21:51,672
"A paradise lies plundered.

1623
02:21:51,673 --> 02:21:53,915
Its roses dried and dying."

1624
02:21:54,083 --> 02:21:58,249
"This heart is torn by a tragedy, tragedy."

1625
02:21:58,416 --> 02:22:00,686
"A paradise lies plundered.

1626
02:22:00,687 --> 02:22:03,124
Its roses dried and dying."

1627
02:22:04,958 --> 02:22:07,124
"Say why did you ditch me?"

1628
02:22:07,208 --> 02:22:09,332
"Now, take my life too, kill me."

1629
02:22:09,416 --> 02:22:15,874
"Say why did you ditch me?"

1630
02:22:15,958 --> 02:22:18,040
"Now, take my life too, kill me."

1631
02:22:18,125 --> 02:22:21,290
"Go away, love."

1632
02:22:22,375 --> 02:22:26,665
"The devil takes your beauty, the devil takes your love."

1633
02:22:26,750 --> 02:22:31,207
"The devil takes your emotional torture from above."

1634
02:22:31,291 --> 02:22:35,499
"The devil takes your beauty, the devil takes your love."

1635
02:22:35,583 --> 02:22:57,624
"The devil takes your emotional torture from above."
