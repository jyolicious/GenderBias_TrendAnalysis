If yet your bIood does not rage, then
it is waterthat fIows in your veins.

2
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:20,039
For what is the fIush of youth,

22
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:11,174

00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:10,710
The four of you wiII be
perfect forthe roIes...

175
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:15,615
And Sonia wiII be my Durga Bhabhi.

176
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:17,511
She reaIIy knows Hindi!

177
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:21,457
AII this taIk of patriotism is boring.

178
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:25,720
Boring? These guys gave their
Iives forthe freedom of your country.

179
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:28,632
What freedom? Have you seen
the state of this country?

180
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:31,802
Excuse me! I beIieve in this country, Karan.

181
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:36,800
Otherwise, why wouId
I be fighting for it?

182
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:41,134
Maybe because it's cooI!
Being a piIot.. fIying an expensive pIane.

183
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:42,639
You get to wear sexy jackets..

184
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:46,977
And the women..
women Iove men in uniforms.

185
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:49,652
Sure I Iove being a piIot.
Sure it's cooI.

186
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:53,655
But I aIso feeI proud of my country,
and I can give my Iife for it.

187
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:57,486
Proud of what?

188
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:58,753
..this country's expIoding popuIation?

189
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:00,990
..or unempIoyment..
or corruption?

190
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:02,663
Which of these are you reaIIy proud of?

191
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:06,769
No country's perfect Karan.
We've got to make it better.

192
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:07,437
Right.

193
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:11,899
Ok, Ajay you make
this country perfect.

194
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:16,008
The minute I get my degree
I'm out of this dump..

195
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,682
You won't be abIe
to Ieave us and go.

196
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,346
She speaks Hindi so weII!

197
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:29,586
Why didn't you teII me you idiot.
I was making a fooI of myseIf.

198
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,928
At Ieast ask them once.

199
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:40,263
So you won't give up.

200
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:45,372
Ok. But nobody wiII turn up.

201
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:52,547
I'II get them. That's a promise.

202
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:59,056
Karan put your cigarette out.

203
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,217
Grandpa!

204
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:06,897
God bIess you.
When did you come?

205
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:11,159
Just Iast night.

206
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:58,247
Good morning Karan.
Back so earIy?

207
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:01,978
I didn't know you were in town.

208
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:05,045
Just arrived an hour ago.

209
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:09,917
It was a Iong fIight..
Everything Ok at coIIege?

210
00:32:11,195 --> 00:32:11,820
Everything's fine Dad.

211
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,488
Have you decided which American
university you want to go to next year?

212
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:22,368
Michigan, Carnegie,
MeIIon, Wharton...

213
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,507
I know the Iist.

214
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:29,342
HeIIo...

215
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:30,678
Karan wait!

216
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:37,010
I can't hearyou cIearIy
caII me Iater.

217
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:41,281
I know that you know about the Iists.

218
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,628
But Iife doesn't just happen to you.

219
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,920
You've got to pIan it..

220
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:50,762
Every second someone
is born in this country.

221
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:56,365
Nobody cares about them.
Neitherthe government nor God.

222
00:32:56,574 --> 00:33:02,308
Do something.
Or eIse you wiII be one of them.

223
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,377
PIease, don't start with your Iectures.

224
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:09,709
SMS generation.
Any conversation that goes beyond..

225
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,047
..four Iines becomes a Iecture.

226
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:19,396
SignaI's weak here. Give me a second.
Excuse me Karan.

227
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:25,565
The deaI is off then,
we are not interested..

228
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:32,571
You know Russian quaIity is doubtfuI,
they can't afford to be arrogant.

229
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:39,715
Anyway in the open market they'd not get
anything cIose to the price we're offering.

230
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:44,686
And you know how many fathers
there are to every deaI in India. Nothing.

231
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:55,096
TeII them we won't bargain,
they shouId wire the money to us.

232
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:23,092
I did try to warn you..
they won't turn up.

233
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:24,921
DJ promised me.

234
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:26,994
Oh! DJ promised you!

235
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:28,798
So you reaIIy are a fiImmaker?

236
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,026
Karan... Why are you so Iate?

237
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:34,638
And where are the others?

238
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:41,805
The Young Guns Of India.
Very dramatic.

239
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:47,678
Where are you going?

240
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,444
WeII that's one part cast.

241
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:54,551
I am sure Karan can teII us
where his friends are.

242
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:10,640
She's an eight. Yeah!

243
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:11,839
Wow! Nine.

244
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:13,442
What a girI!

00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:15,373

246
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,309

247
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:21,276

248
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:25,587
Ten!
WhaT?

249
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:31,124
Dude.. Iooks at those Iegs!

250
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,299
Shake it baby, shake it..

251
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,559
Oh shit!

252
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,394
Don't be siIIy,
that's at Ieast an eight.

253
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:41,333
Thought I'd find you
stuffing yourfaces.

254
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:44,201
You Iazy good-for-nothings.

255
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,667
We were about to come... but..

256
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:48,845
...we are waiting for Karan actuaIIy.

257
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,611
Oh! So you were waiting for Karan.
Yeah!

258
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:52,876
Karan was there on time.

259
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,586
We are waiting for him here
and he was waiting for us there.

260
00:35:57,788 --> 00:35:59,949
What confusion..

261
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:03,888
You're AshfaquIIa Khan.

262
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,620
You're Rajguru.
The hero righT!

263
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,230
And you know who you are?

264
00:36:08,566 --> 00:36:11,160
The Master of Disguise
and Deception.

265
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:12,529
Chandrashekhar Azad.

266
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:14,902

267
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:18,000

That's fine.
We've aIready wasTed a day..

271
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:35,458
AsIam, your sister-in-Iaw Iooks
even better when she's angry.

272
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,365
What are you doing Laxman?

273
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:52,739
Greetings Mishraji.

274
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,908
Party High Command is reaIIy
happy with your work.

275
00:36:56,414 --> 00:37:00,817
These demonstrations that you have
started against Western cuIture..

276
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,711
..they've heIped us
overshadow other parties.

277
00:37:12,096 --> 00:37:17,500
This is foryou.
And this is foryour boys.

278
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,298
It's not necessary, Mishraji.

279
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,696
I'm not doing this for money.

280
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:25,768
I reaIIy beIieve in the
principIes of my party.

281
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:28,178
That's fine Laxman..

282
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:34,718
..but every movement
needs fueI.. Keep it.

283
00:37:56,874 --> 00:38:01,402
There is nothing
you can do to break me.

284
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,373
''Because I have made pain my friend.''

285
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:08,679
''..As I hoId Death's fingers.''

286
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,124
DJ idiot, don't spoiI my concentration.

287
00:38:28,506 --> 00:38:30,098
Look, Death's finger.

288
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,238
''I've committed my Iife
to the freedom of this country.

289
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:40,247
..I know you want me to get married,
but I have made freedom my bride..''

290
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,919
''Your obedient son, Bhagat Singh.''

291
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:47,351
Who taIks Iike this for
God's sake?

292
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:49,253
My bride is freedom..

293
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,960
I think it's a good Iine for Sukhi..

294
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,858
Since no girI is ever going to marry him..

295
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:56,464
Let freedom be his bride.

296
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,101
Laugh bastards, Iaugh.

297
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:25,726
This is the sari round
of the Miss Freedom contest.

298
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:29,324
Just thought it wouId heIp
me get into the character.

299
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,300
Look guys this isn't going to work.

300
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:42,108
You have to work hard to bring
out the characters.

301
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,409
UnIess you emote from within..

302
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,345
..you won't understand these characters.

303
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:53,121
Try.. it wiII come from within you.

304
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:54,791
BURP

305
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:58,017
See, he's got a hoId of his character aIready.

306
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:01,197
You understood the character pretty fast.

307
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:06,636
See! Now you Iook Iike a revoIutionary!

308
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:10,264
Whateveryou say GuIabo,
you need me to create the mood.

309
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:12,939
DJ watch it.

310
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:16,935
Now she's upset!

311
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:25,645
Those are the words of a 23 year oId.

312
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:29,286
That's how oId Bhagat Singh
was when he died: 23.

313
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,487
Those were different times Sue.

314
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:37,128
Today, if you teII peopIe that
you want to give your Iife foryour country..

315
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:38,690
..they'II caII you nuts.

316
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:40,732
ExactIy.

317
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:45,470
I don't think I can reIate to this..

318
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:48,742
That's it. Don't think.

319
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,808
FeeI. Just read the words,
FeeI them.

320
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:56,946
Why don't we try again?

321
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:59,113
Let's try again..

322
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:05,322
I've committed my Iife to
the freedom of this country.

323
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:12,867
..a job..a weII settIed Iife..
these things don't matter anymore.

324
00:41:13,704 --> 00:41:22,772
..I know you want me to get married,
but I have made freedom my bride..

325
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:40,291
I swear on Mother India...

326
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,875
This AsIam is a reaI stud..

327
00:41:57,281 --> 00:42:02,776
Take a Iook at the packaging.
Poetry, paImistry!

328
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:08,620
DJ, I'm scared at times that
I'II remain a bacheIor aII my Iife.

329
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:14,095
Trust me I won't Iet you die a bacheIor.

330
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:14,923
Promise?

331
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:16,822
It's DJ's promise.

332
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:26,235
You'II be writing peopIe's destinies...

333
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:39,918
Your Iove Iine is very strong..

334
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:44,621
The man of your dreams wiII come
aIong in a bIack T-shirt and say:.

335
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:53,300
Do I even have a Iove Iine?

336
00:42:53,504 --> 00:42:55,267
You must have washed it off in the Ioo.

337
00:42:55,472 --> 00:43:00,967
''Defence Minister Shastri has aIso been
impIicated in the MIG-21 kickbacks scandaI,''

338
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:05,114
This is reaIIy depressing.

339
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:08,308
''This is a bIatant Iie.
I am ordering an investigation.''

340
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,276
See you guys.

341
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:51,215
You're my buddy..
I'II drop you home.

342
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:54,323
I don't need any heIp,
it's just two Ianes away.

343
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:58,394
We aren't so drunk..
that we've forgotten where you Iive.

344
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:12,869
Idiots!

345
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:16,374
You're very Iucky to
have friends Iike them.

346
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:24,887
One day this wiII aII end.

347
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,887
We'II aII go our separate ways.

348
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:31,552
But you can aIways keep in touch.

349
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:33,656
Doesn't happen.

350
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:36,423
Life gets busy.

351
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:40,398
Too many probIems.
Getting a job, a house, money.

352
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:54,083
In coIIege we are the
masters of our destinies..

353
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:57,080
But after coIIege we have
to dance to fate's tune.

354
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:09,526
You know GuIabo.
I passed out 5 years ago...

355
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:12,191
..but I stiII hang around..

356
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:14,695
I don't understand.

357
00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:18,966
..I don't ever want to Ieave coIIege.

358
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:20,668
Why?

359
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:27,650
At Ieast in the campus
I'm someone.. peopIe know me.

360
00:46:28,819 --> 00:46:30,684
DJ's somebody...

361
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:38,084
PeopIe expect me to do
something big in Iife.

362
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:43,762
But when I'm out on the streets..

363
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:49,833
I'II just be Iike the rest of
the sIobs in this country.

364
00:47:00,684 --> 00:47:02,777
NameIess. FaceIess. Scared.
Just waIking the streets..

365
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,247
It's the beer...
Everything came out.

366
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:14,922
You know what eIse
I'm scared of?

367
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:18,225
Acting in yourfiIm.

368
00:47:19,903 --> 00:47:22,463
Don't worry.. you're in safe hands.

369
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,125
Where have you been?

370
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:46,660
HeIIo UncIe.. How are you?

371
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:56,201
We'II catch up tomorrow AsIam..

372
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:04,443
You've been drinking?

373
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:08,779
Dad, you know I don't drink.

374
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:12,586
Good-for-nothings..
WhaTever, They're my friends.

375
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:16,520
Friends! They feeI no
shame standing in front of..

376
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,491
..yourfather with aIcohoI on their breath.

377
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:22,526
Why can't you get friends
in your own community?

378
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:26,669
Why do you make friends with peopIe
who corrupt you, disgrace your reIigion..

379
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:28,565
This has nothing to
do with reIigion, Father.

380
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:33,573
Shut up! Don't raise your voice
in the presence of yourfather.

381
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:35,977
He's right.

382
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:43,345
This country has never accepted
MusIims and it never wiII..

383
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,354
How can you be so passive!

384
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:49,925
Do you ever see me
mixing with a Hindu?

385
00:48:50,827 --> 00:48:54,729
I'm not you and I don't want
to be Iike you brother.

386
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:57,933
I can't fiII myseIf with so much hate..

387
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,999
Coward that's what you are.

388
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:02,865
Stop it!

389
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:06,099
I feeI suffocated in this house.
It's the same oId thing every singIe day..

390
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:21,114
CarnivaIs wiII be heId on our
graves every year,

391
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:25,885
That's aII that wiII be Ieft of us,
when we die for our country.

392
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:28,894
WeII said Ashfaq Sahab..

393
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:31,731
If the EngIish couId hearyou they
wouId Ieave this country in a moment.

394
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:35,230
So what has been decided?

395
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:42,303
We'II steaI the Empire's money
from the train that passes Kakori.

396
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,248
And with that money we wiII buy arms.

397
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:48,511
BismiI wiII expIain everything.

398
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:51,483
Yes BismiI.. Where is my Ram?

399
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,485
Ijust can't find my
Ramprasad BismiI.

400
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:58,160
ReIax. We wiII find him.

401
00:49:58,362 --> 00:49:59,954
But where? How?

402
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:02,322
Very soon. Don't you wo..

403
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:06,996
You won't get Ramprasad
BismiI out here.

404
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:10,331
You need a true Indian.

405
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:13,242
How can you find Indian
revoIutionaries amongst..

406
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,639
..peopIe who want to be Westerners?

407
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,280
Ignore him. Let's go.

408
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:21,815
Ramprasad BismiI wished to
be reborn a hundred times..

409
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,117
..so that he couId give his Iife for his
country a hundred times over.

410
00:50:27,324 --> 00:50:28,552
Let's go Sue.

411
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:33,456
So where do you think
I can find my BismiI?

412
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,362
I don't beIieve this.

413
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:48,501
This day, we waIk aIong with death,
and Iaugh at its paIe spectre.

414
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:55,310
We wiII not fearthose crueI swords,
our courage is far sharper.

415
00:50:56,119 --> 00:51:04,458
Mistake not our siIence for submission.
For beneath Iies Iava, moIten.

416
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:16,630
O Martyre, O men of vaIour.
One day The enemy wiII sing your praises.

417
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:21,773
We wiII show our mettIe
when the moment of truth arrives..

418
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:27,280
..for courage Iives in deeds,
not boastfuI Iies.

419
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:31,447
We've gathered in the enemy's Iair,
my friend..

420
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:35,523
In the hope of dying for our motherIand.

421
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:40,355
We wiII not fearthose crueI swords,
our courage is far sharper.

422
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:46,867
This day, we waIk aIong with death,
and Iaugh at its paIe spectre.

423
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:54,070
We wiII not fearthose crueI swords,
our courage is far sharper.

424
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:08,656
Sue, this isn't London.
You don't know what kind..

425
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:09,883
..of scum, men Iike Laxman Pandey are.

426
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:14,052
Look Sue if he is a part of this,
then I can't do the fiIm.

427
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:17,062
If you have any probIems
with me say it on my face.

428
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:21,493
Don't stab me in the back Iike a coward.

429
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:24,500
Pandey Ieave!
We don't want troubIe..

430
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:27,508
Speak you coward.
What were you saying?

431
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:31,375
AsIam, where are you going?

432
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:34,982
Coward, what were you saying?

433
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:39,644
Hey you! How dare you hit AsIam?

434
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:50,093
SUKHI

435
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,999
Thrash him.

436
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:19,725
I'm sorry,
I took you guys in my fiIm.

437
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:23,664
God knows what made me come here..

438
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:43,946
You know we've got a probIem
with Pandey. There's a Iot of bad bIood.

439
00:54:44,147 --> 00:54:49,380
And if I stay, it's sure to happen again.
No, Sue.

440
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:50,710
We've worked it out.

441
00:54:50,987 --> 00:54:52,511
You won't have any probIems.

442
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:04,590
Sue.. we aII know how much
this fiIm means to you.

443
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:09,530
We want to heIp you finish
what you came here to do.

444
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:13,306
Everyone wants you to stay.

445
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:15,304
I want you to stay.

446
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:24,713
Say something...

447
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:30,486
Don't worry, you're in safe hands.

448
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:35,524
Come on.. Get up. ..Come here.

449
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:54,683
She's not going anywhere.

450
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:00,750
Now just chiII.

451
00:58:00,543 --> 00:58:14,048

01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:48,900
Take some soiI of my Iand,
The scenT of This air.

503
01:01:49,272 --> 01:01:57,873
Take some soiI of my Iand,
The scenT of This air.

504
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:02,713
Add The breaTh of my being,
The Throbbing of my heart.

505
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:08,580
And The zeaI,
ThaT races Through my bIood.

506
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:13,425
Take aII These and sTir iT.
Then waTch as iT brings ouT The coIour.

507
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:18,256
WaTch as iT brings ouT The
coIour of paTrioTism, my friend.

508
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:33,614
WaTch as iT brings ouT The coIour.

509
01:03:07,683 --> 01:03:15,317
WaTch as iT brings ouT The
coIour of paTrioTism, my friend.

510
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:49,056
British Officers...
around 20 to 25 of them.

511
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:53,225
We have to caII it off! We've nearIy
reached Kakori. Stop Ashfaq, quick.

512
01:04:02,104 --> 01:04:03,071
Ashfaq, stop!

513
01:04:06,108 --> 01:04:07,905
It's too Iate to back out now...
Come on... Move!

514
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:26,086
Get inside!

515
01:04:40,443 --> 01:04:42,172
Keep the windows shut...

516
01:04:44,647 --> 01:04:45,272
Come on!

517
01:04:46,482 --> 01:04:46,948
The keys!

518
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:48,780
You won't get away with this.

519
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:51,778
Give me the keys!
- I don'T have iT.

520
01:04:52,321 --> 01:04:53,788
Banwari get the sIedge hammer.

521
01:04:58,227 --> 01:04:59,956
I'II handIe them.
You go get the money...

522
01:07:19,135 --> 01:07:21,603
I've committed my Iife
to the freedom of this country.

523
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:27,272
Comfort, and other worIdIy
desires do not attract me.

524
01:07:28,477 --> 01:07:32,277
I know you want me to
get married and settIe down...

525
01:07:32,648 --> 01:07:34,775
...Iike aII parents do.

526
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:37,119
But freedom is my bride.

527
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:44,616
I hope you'II forgive me.
Your most obedient son, Bhagat.

528
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:51,625
Let's take a break.

529
01:07:56,672 --> 01:07:59,971
Breakfast?
No...

530
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:20,987
Put it there.

531
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:26,328
GeneraI Dyer? How can one even think
of doing something Iike this?

532
01:08:29,205 --> 01:08:33,665
I can't beIieve that he actuaIIy kiIIed more
than 400 peopIe at JaIIianwaIa Baugh.

533
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:36,174
379... that was the officiaI figure.

534
01:08:36,879 --> 01:08:39,177
ActuaIIy nearIy 1000
peopIe were butchered...

535
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:52,691
Last year at the tomb of Peer Sai,
I prayed for DaIjeet's weII being.

536
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:54,355
Who's DaIjeet?

537
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:56,690
We were the epitome of toIerance.

538
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:02,701
Even an ant reacts. But we are conditioned
to take everything Iying down.

539
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:06,202
Rubbish! It's today's generation
which Iacks the wiII to do anything

540
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:08,035
Have you ever heard of
Shaheed Uddham Singh?

541
01:09:08,577 --> 01:09:12,206
He went aII the way to London
and kiIIed that Dyer.

542
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:15,717
...because he was aIso a part
of the JaIIianwaIa Baugh massacre.

543
01:09:16,252 --> 01:09:19,881
Eat it Sonia.
The butter wiII strengthen your bones.

544
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:24,215
In Punjab every mother sends
at Ieast one son to the army.

545
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:27,395
Why shouId we retreat?
Sacrifice runs in our bIood.

546
01:09:27,596 --> 01:09:30,394
OnIy idiots Iike DJ retreat.

547
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:32,226
Why does it aIways come back to me?

548
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:35,232
Shut up and eat your paratha.

549
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:38,064
What is the most used word in this country?
ADJUST!

550
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:43,067
Six peopIe sitting on a seat forfour...someone
wiII squeeze in and say - 'PIease adjust!'.

551
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:54,082
Hey! Why are you adjusting?

552
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,257
Strange. Isn't it?

553
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:06,591
We are being hunted Iike
animaIs in our own country...

554
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:12,269
...Ashfaq you shouId cross the border
and get to Afghanistan...

555
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:16,767
...We have many MusIim friends there.
You wiII be safe with them.

556
01:10:17,313 --> 01:10:18,780
After aII, you're one of their own.

557
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:21,112
One of their own?
Hmm...

558
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:23,110
Why don't you think of me
as one of your own?

559
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:28,449
Ashfaq... I never meant...

560
01:10:30,492 --> 01:10:31,117
...Ashfaq...

561
01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:36,790
I didn't mean to hurt you.

562
01:10:38,334 --> 01:10:40,802
This is your country as much as it is mine.

563
01:10:41,837 --> 01:10:45,637
You have a right to fight and die for it too...

564
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:48,972
...Forgive me.

565
01:10:49,178 --> 01:10:50,805
Ram, Iet us not taIk of dying...

566
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:56,482
I pray, that we aII Iive to see
our grandchiIdren grow up in a free country.

567
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:02,149
Ram run!

568
01:12:17,766 --> 01:12:19,563
Where are your otherfriends?

569
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:21,903
Where's Azad?

570
01:54:11,819 --> 01:54:14,982
Our bIood ia ranging.
It'a fIowing through the atreeta.

571
01:54:15,256 --> 01:54:18,123
But it won't go in vain

572
01:54:19,727 --> 01:54:26,656
Our eyea are bIood ahot for a purpose.
A cauae we wiII attain.

573
01:54:27,902 --> 01:54:34,671
It feII from our bodiea,
embraced the earth.

574
01:54:35,509 --> 01:54:38,501
Went winding through atreeta.
A river of courage

575
01:54:38,779 --> 01:54:44,342
...it aurged and awept.

576
01:54:45,253 --> 01:54:54,355
It fIowed to make a new
beginning

577
01:55:07,408 --> 01:55:14,507
From gaping wounda,
and gaahea Iarge,

578
01:55:15,416 --> 01:55:22,413
it oozed, aIowIy and ateadiIy.

579
01:55:22,890 --> 01:55:30,456
WhiIe the pointing fingers,
got fiata in repIy,

580
01:55:31,098 --> 01:55:34,659
yet, our bIood waa raging.

581
01:55:35,102 --> 01:55:40,062
It fIowed not in vain
but with a reaaon.

582
01:55:40,708 --> 01:55:47,079
A cauae we wiII attain.

583
01:55:48,416 --> 01:55:52,580
Our eyea are bIood ahot
for a reaaon.

584
01:55:52,787 --> 01:55:55,585
A cauae we wiII attain.

585
01:55:56,557 --> 01:56:07,195
Our bIood ia raging.
It'a fIowing through the atreeta.

586
01:56:07,401 --> 01:56:12,771
...it aurged and awept.

587
01:56:13,975 --> 01:56:17,433
It fIowed to make a new
beginning

588
01:56:17,645 --> 01:56:23,948
Yet, our bIood waa raging.

589
01:56:24,418 --> 01:56:31,756
Yet, our bIood waa raging.

590
01:56:32,326 --> 01:56:52,510
Yet, our bIood waa raging.

591
01:57:03,758 --> 01:57:06,784
Someone get a doctor! Quick!
We'll take it from here.

592
01:57:33,654 --> 01:57:36,282
They were beating up
innocent people...

593
01:57:38,059 --> 01:57:40,357
Why didn't you
stop them?

594
01:57:40,728 --> 01:57:42,855
You protested against
the government, our own party...

595
01:57:43,064 --> 01:57:43,894
That's unacceptable.

596
01:57:44,799 --> 01:57:46,892
The protest was not
against the government...

597
01:57:47,401 --> 01:57:49,096
...it was forthe truth.

598
01:57:51,072 --> 01:57:53,097
So many pilots have died...

599
01:57:53,307 --> 01:57:56,333
...young innocent boys who were fighting
for our country... killed...

600
01:57:56,577 --> 01:58:01,537
...so that someone in the
government could make money.

601
01:58:02,249 --> 01:58:04,547
And our party office doesn't
do a thing about it.

602
01:58:05,553 --> 01:58:06,281
Come... Sit down.

603
01:58:11,759 --> 01:58:12,521
Have some tea.

604
01:58:19,266 --> 01:58:25,728
Laxman, in politics there's
no place for emotions.

605
01:58:26,607 --> 01:58:28,768
We have big plans foryou.

606
01:58:29,910 --> 01:58:30,740
Big plans.

607
01:58:30,945 --> 01:58:36,315
Only dogs salivate when
you show them bone Mishraji.

608
01:59:08,315 --> 01:59:09,339
How's Aunty?

609
01:59:09,750 --> 01:59:10,876
They're doing an MRl.

610
01:59:30,337 --> 01:59:32,771
She's slipped into a coma.

611
01:59:33,174 --> 01:59:38,441
Severe skull damage,
coupled with the shock of her son's death.

612
01:59:39,346 --> 01:59:43,840
That's an ugly gash.
You need attention.

613
01:59:48,022 --> 01:59:50,217
Aslam...How's he?

614
01:59:54,862 --> 01:59:56,727
What have you come for?
Haven't you done enough damage?

615
02:00:01,368 --> 02:00:03,700
Uncle, it isn't
what you think.

616
02:00:04,171 --> 02:00:09,108
l'm not interested in what you think,
ln what you want to do...

617
02:00:11,045 --> 02:00:12,842
l'm just going to say this once.

618
02:00:13,514 --> 02:00:15,846
Aslam doesn't
know what's good for him.

619
02:00:16,517 --> 02:00:18,917
He's an emotional boy, always has been.
He listens to his heart, not his head.

620
02:00:21,155 --> 02:00:23,589
These are bad times,
for people like us.

621
02:00:24,558 --> 02:00:28,358
Don't take him
down with you.

622
02:00:30,297 --> 02:00:31,025
He's inside.

623
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:32,290
Go on...

624
02:00:52,419 --> 02:00:54,353
All parts working?

625
02:00:56,190 --> 02:00:59,159
Don't make me laugh, idiot.
lt hurts

626
02:01:00,361 --> 02:01:01,419
How's Aunty?

627
02:01:02,696 --> 02:01:03,720
She's in a coma.

628
02:01:07,434 --> 02:01:09,163
How can this be
happening to us?

629
02:01:22,182 --> 02:01:23,342
Some dinner?

630
02:01:23,851 --> 02:01:26,046
No, don't worry Aunty.

631
02:01:27,021 --> 02:01:30,479
We just came to see Aslam.
We've got to get back to the hospital.

632
02:01:31,225 --> 02:01:32,192
Take care.

633
02:01:56,917 --> 02:01:58,350
Listen...l...

634
02:02:01,722 --> 02:02:06,625
...l'm sorry.

635
02:03:09,056 --> 02:03:10,114
Please eat.

636
02:03:33,380 --> 02:03:35,007
Everything's falling apart...

637
02:03:37,818 --> 02:03:39,683
...and all l can do is
stand and watch.

638
02:03:46,927 --> 02:03:49,054
People like us don't count
out here.

639
02:03:54,501 --> 02:04:02,966
This system is so messed up, a hundred more
Ajay's can die and nothing will change.

640
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:36,532
Ajay did everything right,
all his life...

641
02:04:40,547 --> 02:04:47,612
...he was a good pilot,
a good friend, a good son...

642
02:04:48,455 --> 02:04:50,753
...he never harmed a soul.

643
02:04:52,326 --> 02:04:58,856
...he didn't deserve this...

644
02:05:00,667 --> 02:05:02,726
...Sonia didn't deserve this...

645
02:06:10,571 --> 02:06:14,029
Hey Karan...they've
spoilt your jacket.

646
02:06:15,208 --> 02:06:16,607
Long live lndia!

647
02:06:49,142 --> 02:06:51,474
The scoundrel got
away with it again.

648
02:06:52,179 --> 02:06:53,806
There's nothing can we do...

649
02:06:55,248 --> 02:06:57,079
...when the law of the land protects
people like the Defence Minister.

650
02:07:00,187 --> 02:07:02,747
We have to take
drastic measures.

651
02:07:04,224 --> 02:07:05,384
What do you mean?

652
02:07:06,493 --> 02:07:07,892
Do what?

653
02:07:11,531 --> 02:07:12,691
Kill him.

654
02:07:15,135 --> 02:07:16,033
What?

655
02:07:16,970 --> 02:07:20,770
Kill the Defence Minister!
Are you crazy?

656
02:07:21,608 --> 02:07:23,075
We aren't killers Sonia.

657
02:07:23,276 --> 02:07:24,641
But they are.

658
02:07:24,945 --> 02:07:26,378
Have you lost it Karan!

659
02:07:26,580 --> 02:07:28,707
lt's not a blood lust...

660
02:07:29,650 --> 02:07:30,878
...it's a matter of justice.

661
02:07:31,084 --> 02:07:32,551
l'll get the gun.

662
02:07:32,753 --> 02:07:37,622
Don't fuel things, Pandey. We can't
start killing people for any small reason.

663
02:07:38,425 --> 02:07:41,189
You think Ajay's death
is a small reason?

664
02:07:41,662 --> 02:07:43,323
Ajay's mother is
a small reason?

665
02:07:43,630 --> 02:07:46,531
You've got to understand Karan.

666
02:07:47,167 --> 02:07:49,067
Lala Lajpat Rai's death
has to be avenged.

667
02:07:49,269 --> 02:07:50,736
Scott has to be killed.

668
02:07:50,937 --> 02:07:51,869
But...

669
02:08:01,415 --> 02:08:06,910
l always thought we didn't
believe in anything.

670
02:08:07,120 --> 02:08:11,216
So did l. Until now.

671
02:08:21,001 --> 02:08:22,468
Have we all gone crazy?

672
02:08:22,703 --> 02:08:27,402
He takes a morning walk at 8 a.m. everyday,
We'll kill him then.

673
02:08:27,607 --> 02:08:33,512
Who's we, huh?
Who's going to pull the trigger?

674
02:08:33,947 --> 02:08:34,845
l'll do it!

675
02:08:38,251 --> 02:08:42,517
Even though the morning security is relaxed
there is still a danger of getting caught.

676
02:08:42,789 --> 02:08:46,122
There is no looking back now!

677
02:09:30,170 --> 02:09:39,135
The Defence Minister was on his morning walk
when two unidentified gunmen opened fire.

678
02:09:39,446 --> 02:09:45,078
He was hit by three bullets in his chest,and was
declared dead as he reached the hospital.

679
02:09:45,285 --> 02:09:47,344
No group has yet claimed
responsibility forthis incident.

680
02:09:56,062 --> 02:10:01,022
Government spokespersons believe that this is
an attempt to destablise the government.

681
02:10:02,803 --> 02:10:08,173
The country has lost a great leader
because of the cowardly act of some terrorists.

682
02:10:08,742 --> 02:10:10,767
He was a true soldier, a true patriot.

683
02:10:10,977 --> 02:10:18,941
His contribution to the country
cannot be described in words.

684
02:10:20,253 --> 02:10:21,277
Sukhi!

685
02:10:23,323 --> 02:10:25,621
Meanwhile our sources have
discovered a telephonic conversation...

686
02:10:25,826 --> 02:10:29,455
...involving middle man Rajnath Singhania
in an arms deal.

687
02:10:29,763 --> 02:10:34,393
This conversation took place just a few days
before the Defence Minister's assassination.

688
02:10:34,601 --> 02:10:38,298
The Russians want us
to reduce our commission.

689
02:10:38,605 --> 02:10:42,735
Didn't you tell them,
its not a defence deal, but our deal.

690
02:10:43,343 --> 02:10:46,471
That's why l told them. - ''Take it or leave it''

691
02:10:46,680 --> 02:10:50,207
Let's go.

692
02:11:07,100 --> 02:11:08,328
Paaji, where's DJ?

693
02:11:08,535 --> 02:11:10,469
They were just here.

694
02:11:15,775 --> 02:11:17,709
He hasn't come home all night.

695
02:11:21,281 --> 02:11:22,805
ls everything alright?

696
02:11:23,884 --> 02:11:24,782
Yes, ask him to call me.

697
02:11:24,985 --> 02:11:28,580
He said he'd be
spending the night at DJ's.

698
02:11:42,102 --> 02:11:43,535
Have you seen DJ?

699
02:11:46,907 --> 02:11:49,205
ls everything alright?

700
02:11:53,713 --> 02:11:57,274
Come with me...

701
02:12:02,989 --> 02:12:06,288
Don't worry... nothing
will happen to those boys...

702
02:12:07,594 --> 02:12:10,062
Daljeet has always
been a brat..

703
02:12:10,263 --> 02:12:15,462
...he used to disappear
on his bike for days...

704
02:12:21,942 --> 02:12:23,409
l'm scared...

705
02:12:23,977 --> 02:12:26,571
Don't be afraid...

706
02:12:26,947 --> 02:12:29,142
God will take care of everything...

707
02:12:30,784 --> 02:12:36,586
God watches over
the people we love.

708
02:12:47,634 --> 02:12:49,261
Defence Minister...
the martyr...

709
02:12:53,139 --> 02:12:58,076
...one of lndia's favourite sons...
Scoundrel!

710
02:12:59,479 --> 02:13:02,448
They're honouring him
with the National Medal of Honour.

711
02:13:02,983 --> 02:13:07,010
All our efforts, wasted.

712
02:13:07,821 --> 02:13:09,652
People need to
know the truth.

713
02:13:09,856 --> 02:13:12,120
...and who's going to tell them the truth?

714
02:13:12,325 --> 02:13:15,055
We have to
surrender ourselves.

715
02:13:15,328 --> 02:13:16,056
What?

716
02:13:17,230 --> 02:13:26,332
Terriffic! You want us to walk right
in and give ourselves up!

717
02:13:26,539 --> 02:13:27,733
And who should
we surrenderto?

718
02:13:27,941 --> 02:13:30,466
The police are
mere puppets.

719
02:13:30,677 --> 02:13:33,737
Should we just
sit back?

720
02:13:33,947 --> 02:13:37,576
No! Let's kill
them all!

721
02:13:37,784 --> 02:13:39,115
Right Pandey?

722
02:13:39,319 --> 02:13:40,980
Someone make
him shut up!

723
02:13:49,896 --> 02:13:51,989
You always knew that
yourfather was in it.

724
02:13:53,700 --> 02:13:54,997
You knew everything.

725
02:13:58,204 --> 02:13:59,000
No Sukhi...

726
02:13:59,205 --> 02:14:02,572
You're lying!

727
02:14:03,276 --> 02:14:05,267
You always wanted to take
revenge on yourfather.

728
02:14:05,478 --> 02:14:06,376
Sukhi, shut up!

729
02:14:06,579 --> 02:14:11,141
Who am l to say anything?

730
02:14:11,885 --> 02:14:15,844
DJ he's used you...

731
02:14:16,556 --> 02:14:21,619
...he's used all of us...

732
02:14:22,128 --> 02:14:26,531
Mark my words,
his father will bail him out.

733
02:14:26,733 --> 02:14:29,258
But we'll get caught.
And l don't want to die DJ...

734
02:14:29,469 --> 02:14:31,903
l don't want to die.

735
02:14:38,912 --> 02:14:40,903
We did all this for Ajay.

736
02:14:45,285 --> 02:14:46,650
What will happen now DJ?

737
02:14:55,295 --> 02:14:56,694
You've decided?

738
02:14:57,397 --> 02:15:03,495
l need to know the truth...
don't worry.

739
02:15:04,604 --> 02:15:08,040
l'm not worried.
Just don't be late.

740
02:15:23,690 --> 02:15:25,123
Nothing will happen
to you Karan.

741
02:15:26,860 --> 02:15:27,758
That's a promise.

742
02:15:28,394 --> 02:15:30,919
Just give me the
names of the others.

743
02:15:32,132 --> 02:15:38,037
l'll get you the best lawyers,
pull all the strings possible.

744
02:15:38,872 --> 02:15:44,208
You were forced into it, do you
understand? You were forced.

745
02:15:48,715 --> 02:15:51,411
Do you get me?

746
02:15:53,953 --> 02:15:57,252
Yourfather's reputation,
his life's work is at stake.

747
02:15:57,690 --> 02:15:59,749
Why did you do it?

748
02:16:03,263 --> 02:16:04,252
Why did you do it, Dad?

749
02:16:04,464 --> 02:16:07,228
What did l do?

750
02:16:08,067 --> 02:16:12,629
Ajay always said,
''l'll give my life forthis country.''

751
02:16:13,606 --> 02:16:18,134
''...l'm not afraid of death.''

752
02:16:21,648 --> 02:16:35,119
Ajay was burnt alive... and all you can
think of is sending me out of the country...

753
02:16:36,062 --> 02:16:37,757
You killed him!

754
02:16:38,698 --> 02:16:41,064
You made a joke of his death...

755
02:16:41,301 --> 02:16:43,895
l know you're very disturbed...

756
02:16:44,370 --> 02:16:49,774
Relax! Let me
handle things.

757
02:16:50,710 --> 02:16:53,406
l'll find a way out.

758
02:16:54,314 --> 02:16:55,576
Really Dad?
ls there a way out?

759
02:16:55,815 --> 02:16:58,147
Of course.

760
02:18:06,953 --> 02:18:10,480
You don't have
to do this...

761
02:18:14,827 --> 02:18:17,762
Sukhi, this might
end badly.

762
02:18:20,199 --> 02:18:25,296
Without you guys it will
end for me anyway...

763
02:18:26,472 --> 02:18:27,564
ldiot.

764
02:18:38,918 --> 02:18:45,790
Ajay's death, won't go in vain,
Ma. l promise you.

765
02:19:21,894 --> 02:19:31,394
This is Rahul, and you've tuned
in to yourfavourite radio show...

766
02:20:50,183 --> 02:20:53,641
Hey Karan!
What're you doing here?

767
02:20:53,953 --> 02:20:55,079
We need a favour.

768
02:20:55,288 --> 02:20:56,312
Sure!

769
02:20:56,656 --> 02:20:57,918
l need you to
put us on air.

770
02:20:59,125 --> 02:21:02,925
Put you on air?

771
02:21:03,129 --> 02:21:04,926
Yeah, now!

772
02:21:05,364 --> 02:21:08,925
That's impossible man...
l'll lose my job.

773
02:21:09,135 --> 02:21:10,762
...as it is, they
don't pay me.

774
02:21:12,138 --> 02:21:14,436
lt's payback time.

775
02:21:14,640 --> 02:21:18,770
Hey! Whateveryou say DJ!
lt's your station.

776
02:21:20,646 --> 02:21:22,341
Gun... He's got a gun!

777
02:21:22,548 --> 02:21:24,778
Karan you go in.
l'll handle it.

778
02:21:26,152 --> 02:21:31,556
Keep the show on.
Don't mess with us.

779
02:21:35,161 --> 02:21:37,629
Come on... leave.

780
02:21:40,700 --> 02:21:42,133
Paaji is anyone inside?

781
02:21:44,504 --> 02:21:47,803
Uncleji run. Don't stop.

782
02:21:49,509 --> 02:21:53,309
Gun... Security he's got a gun!

783
02:21:55,081 --> 02:21:56,981
Don't be a wise guy.

784
02:21:57,183 --> 02:22:03,588
Everybody leave!
Out! Move!

785
02:22:03,789 --> 02:22:06,485
Don't panic we won't
harm anyone.

786
02:22:06,692 --> 02:22:14,599
Move! Move! Move!

787
02:22:15,935 --> 02:22:21,840
Hurry up, quick!

788
02:22:38,057 --> 02:22:44,587
The time is 6:05 a.m. And you're listening
to ''The night is still young''.

789
02:22:44,797 --> 02:22:47,698
Today l've got a
surprise guest foryou.

790
02:22:48,067 --> 02:22:52,527
An old friend of mine Karan Singhania, who just
dropped in to say something to all of you...

791
02:23:00,279 --> 02:23:06,445
My name is Karan Singhania... My friends
and l... we killed the Defence Minister...

792
02:23:08,154 --> 02:23:12,420
l repeat we killed
the Defence Minister...

793
02:23:12,625 --> 02:23:15,958
Ravi take me to the radio
station quickly. Hurry up!

794
02:23:16,362 --> 02:23:21,425
We are not terrorists. We aren't
backed by any foreign organisation.

795
02:23:22,435 --> 02:23:24,335
We don't even belong to
any political group...

796
02:23:26,038 --> 02:23:28,063
We're just five students
from Delhi University.

797
02:23:29,108 --> 02:23:31,406
We killed the
Defense Minister because...

798
02:23:32,678 --> 02:23:40,778
...he murdered ourfriend Flight Lieutenant Ajay
Rathod and many other Air Force pilots...

799
02:23:41,120 --> 02:23:45,750
We killed him because after he
murdered Ajay, he murdered his name...

800
02:23:47,259 --> 02:23:58,102
Ajay's mother, right now,
is fighting for her life...

801
02:24:01,040 --> 02:24:05,443
A Defence Minister is supposed to
safegaurd a nation. Not sell it.

802
02:24:06,812 --> 02:24:13,308
Men like the Defence Minister
aren't just above the law...they control it.

803
02:24:14,320 --> 02:24:22,694
We killed him because someone
had to say, ''Enough!''.

804
02:24:23,295 --> 02:24:24,785
We might be wrong...

805
02:24:25,831 --> 02:24:27,856
...because its a sin to
kill someone.

806
02:24:28,968 --> 02:24:30,833
But we couldn't tolerate it anymore.

807
02:24:31,737 --> 02:24:33,967
Today we are here to confess to our sin.

808
02:24:35,307 --> 02:24:38,799
Today we are here to tell everybody
that something has to be done

809
02:24:40,780 --> 02:24:42,509
lt's got to be done.

810
02:24:45,785 --> 02:24:49,983
We've just received news that Defence Minister's
assassins are hiding in All lndia Radio building.

811
02:24:50,389 --> 02:24:59,821
Karan Singhania and his friends are still
with us. Listeners can call in on 3291777.

812
02:25:00,533 --> 02:25:01,830
Until then, here is
''Roobaroo''

813
02:25:11,143 --> 02:25:12,075
lt's done.

814
02:25:22,288 --> 02:25:23,915

Will they give us

Food?
Next he'll want beer.

828
02:27:08,127 --> 02:27:13,895
You guys have become famous. Calls are
pouring in from all overthe country.

829
02:27:14,099 --> 02:27:15,794
Come on!
They want to talk to you...

830
02:27:22,408 --> 02:27:23,033
Police!

831
02:27:24,243 --> 02:27:26,871
This is unreal man. Where
did they come from?

832
02:27:27,079 --> 02:27:28,774
This will ruin my career...

833
02:27:28,981 --> 02:27:30,778
Shut up!

834
02:27:32,117 --> 02:27:37,419
Karan you get on air...
We don't have much time...

835

Take care.

836
02:27:43,863 --> 02:27:48,300
The Delhi police have reached the spot and are
rescuing civilians trapped in the building.

02:28:06,051 --> 02:28:09,020
Hi, my name is Prakash.
And l want to congratulate you.

842
02:28:09,221 --> 02:28:14,249
You did the right thing by killing him.
All our ministers should be lined up and shot.

843
02:28:14,894 --> 02:28:18,330
Prakash, who all
will you shoot?

844
02:28:18,731 --> 02:28:23,600
These corrupt ministers are a reflection
of our society. We've chosen them.

845
02:28:27,039 --> 02:28:28,904
We need to change ourselves
to bring about a change.

846
02:28:29,875 --> 02:28:34,335
Hello! This is
Principal Sharma from lndore...

847
02:28:34,680 --> 02:28:38,582
You have set a terrible example by
taking the law into your own hands.

848
02:28:40,052 --> 02:28:43,544
You're right sir.
We're sorry.

849
02:28:44,423 --> 02:28:50,020
But give me the name of one
politician who has gone to jail for his crimes.

850
02:28:51,196 --> 02:28:52,823
Who else is on
your hit-list?l

851
02:28:53,565 --> 02:28:54,998
We have no hit-list.

852
02:28:56,368 --> 02:28:58,563
How do you feel after
killing the Defence Minister?

853
02:28:58,771 --> 02:29:03,799
We did not kill him out
of any blood lust...

854
02:29:22,628 --> 02:29:26,086
lf you get caught you'll be hanged.
Aren't you afraid?

855
02:29:27,066 --> 02:29:27,964
No.

856
02:29:35,808 --> 02:29:39,505
The college students who
have claimed responsibility ...

857
02:29:39,712 --> 02:29:41,043
...are still inside.

858
02:29:41,847 --> 02:29:49,117
Karan, while we applaud your courage,
do you think you'll escape?

859
02:29:49,621 --> 02:29:51,111
lf we wanted to escape, we wouldn't
have been here in the first place.

860
02:30:33,198 --> 02:30:36,565
Shit! They're shooting at us DJ!
They're shooting at us!

861
02:30:36,769 --> 02:30:41,035
Shut up for a second!

862
02:30:42,941 --> 02:30:46,069
They're mistaking us forterrorists.
They think we're armed.

863
02:30:48,280 --> 02:30:53,115
Wait a minute!
l'll try to handle it.

864
02:31:13,338 --> 02:31:19,834
No Sukhi!
What did you do!

865
02:31:22,548 --> 02:31:26,712
Shit DJ! Just when l was getting
good with the girls...

866
02:31:49,975 --> 02:31:53,502
My name is lndra.What's the difference
between you and a terrorist?

867
02:31:53,712 --> 02:31:59,844
There's a big difference.
Terrorists kill innocent people. we didn't...

868
02:32:07,326 --> 02:32:14,232
Aslam, close
the door. Quick!

869
02:32:16,535 --> 02:32:18,435
We are not terrorists.
Why don't they...

870
02:33:10,255 --> 02:33:13,315
lt's not a lust for blood ...
it's a matter of justice!

871
02:33:13,792 --> 02:33:19,287
Why are bullets being used when its
clearthat these are college students?

872
02:35:04,169 --> 02:35:13,100
No matter what you do, this country
will never change. lt has no future.

873
02:35:16,481 --> 02:35:21,976
No country is perfect.
You've got to make it perfect.

874
02:35:25,657 --> 02:35:31,721
Join the police,
military, lAS...

875
02:35:33,131 --> 02:35:35,895
Become a part of
the political system..

876
02:35:38,503 --> 02:35:43,668
This country will change...
We will change it!

877
02:35:45,577 --> 02:35:49,013
lf you believed the Defence Minister
deserved to be punished then...

878
02:35:49,715 --> 02:35:53,742
...what about the allegations against
yourfather? Why such double standards?

879
02:35:56,588 --> 02:35:57,919
We'll find a way
to fix this.

880
02:35:59,591 --> 02:36:00,922
There's just one way
to fix this Dad.

881
02:36:20,746 --> 02:36:21,713
l'm sorry Dad...

882
02:36:51,676 --> 02:36:53,143
My name is Daljeet Singh.

883
02:36:55,080 --> 02:36:57,139
There are only two
ways to live your life.

884
02:36:58,350 --> 02:37:04,255
Tolerate things the
way they are...

885
02:37:05,857 --> 02:37:09,816
...Ortake responsibility
to change them.

886
02:37:12,864 --> 02:37:18,496
Karan Singhania killed his
father before coming here.

887
02:37:25,444 --> 02:37:31,781
Shit DJ!
You're bleeding badly!

888
02:37:32,951 --> 02:37:39,151
Relax! lt got tired of flowing in my veins.
lt just wanted to be free.

889
02:37:41,159 --> 02:37:43,627
Aslam...Laxman...Sukhi?

890
02:37:44,896 --> 02:37:45,794
All gone.

891
02:37:58,577 --> 02:38:02,877
...Karan, l think l'm in love...

892
02:38:05,684 --> 02:38:07,242
... l nevertold you dude...

893
02:38:09,154 --> 02:38:12,419
...l can't stop thinking
about her...

894
02:38:16,294 --> 02:38:17,852
l know...she's something else.

895
02:38:21,032 --> 02:38:23,592
You two'll make
a great couple.

896
02:38:29,007 --> 02:38:35,207
There's just one problem though. l don't know
Whetherthe kids will be black or white.

897
02:38:59,971 --> 02:39:02,940
Let me go!
They're just boys, damn it!

898
02:40:22,787 --> 02:40:25,347
We'll turn this spark into a raging fire.

899
02:40:25,557 --> 02:40:28,958
This will swell like a wave and
will bring an end to corruption.

900
02:40:32,897 --> 02:40:37,561
lf we want to shake the entire population out of
their slumberthen we need an explosion like this.

901
02:40:44,376 --> 02:40:48,938
When we grow out of this, well be a nation
which is beautiful and free of corruption.

902
02:40:55,754 --> 02:40:59,713
Lord, accept the sacrifices of these children.

903
02:41:48,707 --> 02:41:50,174
Come Bhagat..

904
02:41:53,011 --> 02:41:55,002
Dad, what are you doing?

905
02:41:55,380 --> 02:41:59,339
l'm sowing mango seeds.
lf l plant one, a thousand will grow.
