1
00:01:09,246 --> 00:01:17,782
"The moon will stealthily enter
through the window in bare feet"

2
00:01:17,854 --> 00:01:25,459
"O beloved, listen to me,
listen to me, my darling"

3
00:01:26,097 --> 00:01:35,135
"The moon will stealthily enter
through the window in bare feet"

4
00:01:49,886 --> 00:01:53,451
Hey, what are you watching?
Is this a Ramlila?

5
00:01:56,026 --> 00:01:59,328
Hey, you. Stop. - Sir, I've got to
go to the station.

6
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:01,664
Do I have to write it down for you?
Can't you hear?

7
00:02:01,665 --> 00:02:03,832
Sorry sir, Sorry.
- You can't go from here.

8
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:08,729
There has been an accident.
Take a U-turn and go back. Go...

9
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:22,777
Today 6.30 p. M Marine Lines Station

10
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:27,450
What are you doing here?
Waiting for Suhani?

11
00:03:27,451 --> 00:03:28,584
Like always.

12
00:03:28,585 --> 00:03:31,321
If you'd married me, you wouldn't
have had to do all this.

13
00:03:31,322 --> 00:03:32,755
If she doesn't come in the
next ten minutes...

14
00:03:32,756 --> 00:03:35,791
We'll run away to a temple
and get married.

15
00:03:35,792 --> 00:03:40,924
Let's go.

16
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:09,783
Is Suhani there?

17
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,954
Did she say where she was going?

18
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,894
Are you sure she is not somewhere
there... in the hospital?

19
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:28,237
Okay, I'll disconnect
the phone.

20
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:21,422
2 years before in Naangav

21
00:05:47,123 --> 00:05:53,555
"It overflowed... the water from
the pitcher overflowed"

22
00:05:54,098 --> 00:06:00,667
"It overflowed, for the
eye could not hold"

23
00:06:15,151 --> 00:06:18,821
"Mother said, don't go.
Brother, I didn't listen to him"

24
00:06:18,822 --> 00:06:24,583
"Father said, just one day more.
And it overflowed"

25
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:29,398
"Gudda said don't go.
Guddi too said the same"

26
00:06:29,399 --> 00:06:35,137
"Friend said, just one day more.
And it overflowed..."

27
00:06:36,372 --> 00:06:42,612
"The water from the
pitcher overflowed"

28
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:50,110
"It overflowed, for the eyes
couldn't hold"

29
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,507
There goes one more.
Another one bites the dust.

30
00:07:20,584 --> 00:07:21,684
He used to be quite a happy guy.

31
00:07:21,685 --> 00:07:23,085
Now he's gone and stuck his
head in a noose.

32
00:07:23,086 --> 00:07:26,822
Why? What's wrong with our girl?
- Your girl?

33
00:07:27,324 --> 00:07:30,225
So big? How old are you?

34
00:07:30,226 --> 00:07:33,396
It's the magic of LUX beauty soap!
What else?

35
00:07:33,397 --> 00:07:36,932
Are you done speaking?
- Yes.

36
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:40,235
What was it you were saying about
putting his head in a noose?

37
00:07:40,236 --> 00:07:41,403
When it comes to
wearing the garland...

38
00:07:41,404 --> 00:07:44,407
Why'd you all stick your heads
out like tortoises?

39
00:07:44,408 --> 00:07:48,199
It's just that this tortoise did not
know that you live in this village.

40
00:07:48,745 --> 00:07:51,246
I am very pleased to meet you.
What's your name?

41
00:07:51,247 --> 00:07:52,181
Ruin.

42
00:07:52,182 --> 00:07:55,150
What's the matter Adi?
- I thought marriage was ruin.

43
00:07:55,151 --> 00:07:57,052
Ok. So what if it's not you.

44
00:07:57,053 --> 00:08:01,057
There are other men who will
willingly die for me.

45
00:08:01,058 --> 00:08:03,292
Hey, you mirchi (chili)

46
00:08:03,293 --> 00:08:06,929
Here's a bitter gourd.
Eat it. You and your disciples.

47
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,663
Adi, what's she saying
& going away?

48
00:08:08,664 --> 00:08:12,468
Don't put your lips to it.
She's quite bitter.

49
00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:18,867
"As she walked, she said
your house was small"

50
00:08:26,283 --> 00:08:28,518
"I left my songs behind.
Under the wings of a bird"

51
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,753
By the way, who is this girl who
just gave this shagun?

52
00:08:30,754 --> 00:08:32,220
Why? Do you also want the shagun?
- No... no.

53
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:35,758
She talks a lot.
Quite a wily girl.

54
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:37,292
Listen Mister,
she's my daughter.

55
00:08:37,293 --> 00:08:38,960
Daughter!

56
00:08:38,961 --> 00:08:41,531
No, I meant she is very gifted.

57
00:08:41,532 --> 00:08:44,600
Faux paus... I'm dead meat.

58
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:46,802
By the way... what is her name?

59
00:08:46,803 --> 00:08:50,071
Boy, if you weren't a guest I would
have made mincemeat out of you.

60
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:51,139
Get lost... mannerless.

61
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:57,242
"And the water from the
pitcher overflowed"

62
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:04,313
"It overflowed, for the eyes
couldn't hold"

63
00:09:04,888 --> 00:09:08,590
"Mother said don't go.
Brother said I didn't listen"

64
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:14,353
"Father said just one day more.
And the water overflowed"

65
00:09:15,465 --> 00:09:19,167
"The crow said don't go.
So did the saint..."

66
00:09:19,168 --> 00:09:26,271
"The crow said, just one day more.
And it overflowed"

67
00:09:36,186 --> 00:09:39,886
Oh Ruin, I was looking for you.

68
00:09:39,957 --> 00:09:43,954
Even my father is looking for you.
- Oh God... Escape!

69
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:50,865
You have a great smile.

70
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:54,704
I had heard that village girls are
very simple and innocent.

71
00:09:54,705 --> 00:09:55,437
Shy!

72
00:09:55,438 --> 00:09:59,071
Excuse me aunty! Here, she is both
simple and shy.

73
00:10:00,277 --> 00:10:02,577
Great son! - Greetings.

74
00:10:02,578 --> 00:10:09,944
"Father... I left your courtyard"

75
00:10:10,187 --> 00:10:30,863
"Your courtyard...
I left it behind"

76
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:37,674
"When I come home next time,
bring a diamond ring"

77
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:50,426
"My friends will play with it
on their laps..."

78
00:10:50,427 --> 00:10:54,062
"A bouncing bonny baby"

79
00:10:54,063 --> 00:11:04,606
"When the monsoons come this time"

80
00:11:04,607 --> 00:11:07,942
"Another kind of separation
will have its say..."

81
00:11:07,943 --> 00:11:13,803
"Separation from my beloved"

82
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:46,013
RAILWAY COLONY, MUMBAI.

83
00:11:51,388 --> 00:11:53,355
Close the book and
open your mouth and eat.

84
00:11:53,356 --> 00:11:55,457
This way nothing will go in either
your mouth or your brain.

85
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,993
Oh mom, if I fail, you'll haul me
over burning coals.

86
00:11:57,994 --> 00:12:00,162
No. I'll eat you raw.

87
00:12:00,163 --> 00:12:02,831
The things your father has to
endure for your studies.

88
00:12:02,832 --> 00:12:06,368
Please quit fighting.
- What else should I do?

89
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:08,504
Now, why are you not eating?

90
00:12:08,505 --> 00:12:11,172
The paratha is so oily and
the yogurt is so sour.

91
00:12:11,173 --> 00:12:13,341
Then, how come Dina ate it?

92
00:12:13,342 --> 00:12:15,845
Oh God! Dina! Dina! Dina!

93
00:12:15,846 --> 00:12:19,782
She's the only one you like.
The rest are all second rate.

94
00:12:19,783 --> 00:12:21,015
Now, will you two stop it?

95
00:12:21,016 --> 00:12:23,351
Mom, she has an exam today.

96
00:12:23,352 --> 00:12:26,855
What should I do with this girl?

97
00:12:26,856 --> 00:12:28,389
Hey, where're you going?

98
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,359
You carry your anger on the
tip of your tongue.

99
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,959
Once you become a doctor,
your patients will die without a hiccup.

100
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:37,866
If something happens to me,
don't ever take me to her.

101
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:39,368
This girl is a real burden.

102
00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:40,869
So why don't you give me
away to him?

103
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,037
To whom?

104
00:12:42,038 --> 00:12:47,143
He who believes that a girl
is a burden.

105
00:12:47,144 --> 00:12:51,808
Do your exam well.

106
00:12:52,082 --> 00:12:54,383
Dad! Good I met you.
Now my paper will go off well.

107
00:12:54,384 --> 00:12:56,384
Your blessings are very important
for doing well.

108
00:12:56,385 --> 00:12:58,720
Go via the temple.
Here, keep some money.

109
00:12:58,721 --> 00:13:03,988
Dad, she sends others to the
temple for her.

110
00:13:05,061 --> 00:13:08,898
You are so pretty.
One kiss on this cheek.

111
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:09,898
Your beard is hurting.

112
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:12,734
My beard hurts... let it.

113
00:13:12,735 --> 00:13:17,239
Some things also hurt me...
Hurt me a lot.

114
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,177
Hi uncle. - Hi Pinks.

115
00:13:21,178 --> 00:13:23,845
And rub yourself clean.

116
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:25,748
The smoke must have
clogged your pores.

117
00:13:25,749 --> 00:13:29,176
Do you know what your son did yesterday?
- Why, is he not your son?

118
00:13:29,586 --> 00:13:33,515
I saw him on a motorcycle...
with a long haired woman.

119
00:13:33,657 --> 00:13:35,090
Both of them were in flames.

120
00:13:35,091 --> 00:13:36,425
Even smoke was coming out
of their mouths.

121
00:13:36,426 --> 00:13:39,853
Dad! Why are you beating about the bush?
Get to the point.

122
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:43,098
Mom, Dad saw me smoking a
cigarette yesterday.

123
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:45,768
Cigarette!
They were smoking a cigar.

124
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:48,103
A Peace pipe. He would take a drag
and pass it to her...

125
00:13:48,104 --> 00:13:51,139
She would take a drag
and pass it back.

126
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,008
What a good for nothing. Son, I've.

127
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:56,278
Who was she? - Like a brother.

128
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,779
Adding glitter to the Gold.

129
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,682
She is just like a boy.

130
00:13:59,683 --> 00:14:02,283
She must have been Meera, mom.

131
00:14:02,284 --> 00:14:05,921
Even you scolded her for
talking like boys.

132
00:14:05,922 --> 00:14:08,990
And if I smoked one cigarette,
what great sin have I committed?

133
00:14:08,991 --> 00:14:14,224
You have done a great deed.

134
00:14:26,308 --> 00:14:32,673
"It overflowed... the water from
the pitcher overflowed".

135
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:40,050
"It overflowed for the
eye couldn't hold".

136
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,841
You don't know anything about her...

137
00:14:59,842 --> 00:15:04,136
And you want us to find one girl
in a population of 12 million.

138
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:08,343
What's the population of Bombay?
- 12 million.

139
00:15:08,551 --> 00:15:10,853
How many of them will be women?
- 50%

140
00:15:10,854 --> 00:15:12,955
6 million approximately.

141
00:15:12,956 --> 00:15:15,557
Out of these 6 million, how many
would be college going?

142
00:15:15,558 --> 00:15:17,927
Hardly 10%
- No no, less than that.

143
00:15:17,928 --> 00:15:20,461
Let's assume 10% So how many is that?
- 600,000.

144
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:23,164
Out of these 600,000, how many
would be medical students?

145
00:15:23,165 --> 00:15:26,802
So, she is a doctor. Lets say 1%

146
00:15:26,803 --> 00:15:28,303
How many? How many?

147
00:15:28,304 --> 00:15:32,405
600, no no no. 6000.
- Your maths is very weak.

148
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:34,542
Out of this 6000, how many
would travel in a local train?

149
00:15:34,543 --> 00:15:36,210
Only in the city of Bombay?

150
00:15:36,211 --> 00:15:37,845
Most would travel by car.

151
00:15:37,846 --> 00:15:43,185
Leaving out buses, taxis and autos,
at least 1% will use local trains.

152
00:15:43,186 --> 00:15:45,754
So, how many does that leave us with?
- Barely 60.

153
00:15:45,755 --> 00:15:48,157
So, out of 60 medical students.

154
00:15:48,158 --> 00:15:54,358
Is it so difficult... to search for
1 medical student?

155
00:15:54,697 --> 00:15:57,899
Come quickly.

156
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,768
"Life is a pleasant journey"

157
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:02,837
She is looking at you.

158
00:16:02,838 --> 00:16:06,369
"What happens tomorrow,
no one knows..."

159
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:21,953
"Sing and dance through your life...
don't bother what the world has to say"

160
00:16:22,826 --> 00:16:27,853
Don't bother. Correct.

161
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:35,738
I think you are in love.

162
00:16:35,739 --> 00:16:39,098
There is no such perversity in my mind.
- What do you mean?

163
00:16:39,274 --> 00:16:42,311
I mean I have not lost my bearings.

164
00:16:42,312 --> 00:16:46,248
All that is for the unoccupied.

165
00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:50,314
Mister, this is not love.
This is lust.

166
00:16:50,386 --> 00:16:53,713
It's also called desire or hunger.

167
00:16:53,822 --> 00:16:55,523
Now repeat what I said.

168
00:16:55,524 --> 00:16:58,060
Shut up Mr. Psychic.

169
00:16:58,061 --> 00:17:01,095
Look son, after seeing this girl's body
once... you've lost your balance.

170
00:17:01,096 --> 00:17:02,630
After seeing her gait... you've
forgotten where you are going,

171
00:17:02,631 --> 00:17:06,000
Do you call this love?

172
00:17:06,001 --> 00:17:08,636
So what do we call it?
- As a famous poet once said:

173
00:17:08,637 --> 00:17:14,076
"What we call love is nothing
but a perversity of the mind"

174
00:17:14,077 --> 00:17:16,077
What do you mean perversity?

175
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,880
In medical terms...

176
00:17:17,881 --> 00:17:20,348
It means that your hormones
are working overtime.

177
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,749
Shut up.

178
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,248
In Hindi, that means keep your
nonsense to yourself.

179
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,626
Your face is saying it all.
- What?

180
00:17:31,627 --> 00:17:34,262
That I've lost my bearing!?

181
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:39,168
It looks like there is a fire in you.
- Shut up.

182
00:17:39,169 --> 00:17:41,970
"This life is a pleasant journey..."

183
00:17:41,971 --> 00:17:47,465
Shut up Dina, let me sleep.

184
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,756
He's not here.
Get off the train.

185
00:18:00,757 --> 00:18:03,791
Why don't you look on top.
Maybe he's dancing on the roof.

186
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,160
Very funny!

187
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:07,362
By the time you see him,
the train would have started.

188
00:18:07,363 --> 00:18:13,028
Look there. Over there...
your lover boy.

189
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:22,739
Aren't you going to get off?

190
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,214
Hello!

191
00:19:00,215 --> 00:19:04,286
Hi!

192
00:19:04,287 --> 00:19:08,522
Who are you looking for?
- Nobody.

193
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:11,559
That girl there?
Whose taking off her...

194
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,529
Taking the clothes off the line?

195
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,499
Do you know her name?

196
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:22,203
Do you know how to whistle?
...Like this? Good.

197
00:19:22,438 --> 00:19:24,873
You look like a decent man.
Make some noise...

198
00:19:24,874 --> 00:19:30,300
What? - Accelerate your bike.

199
00:19:30,313 --> 00:19:32,547
Dina

200
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:34,849
See. It worked.

201
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:36,451
What are you doing there?

202
00:19:36,452 --> 00:19:39,188
Coming, I was just showing
him the way.

203
00:19:39,189 --> 00:19:40,389
Poor thing, didn't know where to go.

204
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:45,417
Dina, are you coming up or not?

205
00:19:54,737 --> 00:19:57,639
This life is a pleasant journey.

206
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,274
Where? - Who?

207
00:19:59,275 --> 00:20:00,541
Why are you singing this song now?

208
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:04,005
Life is a pleasant journey.

209
00:20:05,714 --> 00:20:08,650
Miss. Suhani, I miss you very much.

210
00:20:08,651 --> 00:20:12,054
Morning, noon and night...
your face haunts me.

211
00:20:12,055 --> 00:20:18,227
Either stop haunting me or tell me
what we both should do.

212
00:20:18,228 --> 00:20:20,929
Miss. Suhani, I miss you very much.

213
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:21,662
Morning, noon and night...
your face haunts me.

214
00:20:21,663 --> 00:20:27,590
Shut up Dina. He's mad.

215
00:20:42,684 --> 00:20:46,220
He's even landed here.
- He's the same chap, isn't he?

216
00:20:46,221 --> 00:20:49,057
Yes. The madman has come here also.
Excuse me.

217
00:20:49,058 --> 00:20:50,259
Yes, I'll give her moral support.

218
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,626
Where are you going?
- Body Guard.

219
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:56,864
No, you come here. Come with me.

220
00:20:56,865 --> 00:21:01,563
What's your name?

221
00:21:03,106 --> 00:21:04,306
Aditya.

222
00:21:04,307 --> 00:21:06,974
Are you after girls leaving
your studies behind?

223
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:09,176
Looks like your father has a
lot of money to waste.

224
00:21:09,177 --> 00:21:11,445
Yeah. That's just,
what he says too.

225
00:21:11,446 --> 00:21:14,048
How many times have you failed
in your class?

226
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:19,082
I haven't so far. But may be this time
it'll happen.

227
00:21:26,996 --> 00:21:31,197
"Dear friend..."

228
00:21:32,367 --> 00:21:35,933
"Your soft, lilting laughter"

229
00:21:42,944 --> 00:21:46,442
"I heard it and drank it all up"

230
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:14,138
"May you always laugh like this,
and blush shyly"

231
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:19,413
"And light and darkness meet on the
nape of your neck, under your curls..."

232
00:22:19,414 --> 00:22:24,811
"May your fragrant laughter grow
and envelop me..."

233
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:50,842
"Don't go in the garden dressed
in yellow sunshine"

234
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:59,948
"The bees will tease you,
so don't go among the flowers"

235
00:23:01,523 --> 00:23:11,893
"Laugh softly again...
your beautiful laughter..."

236
00:23:11,901 --> 00:23:17,002
"Lying on the lawn,
like freshly fallen leaves"

237
00:23:17,106 --> 00:23:22,274
"There are seven hues in one sensuous
move of Spring"

238
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:27,013
"The rainy season... it's all you"

239
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:37,185
"Laugh season to season...
that soft laughter of yours"

240
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:42,062
"Dear friend..."

241
00:23:43,199 --> 00:23:49,899
"Your soft lilting laugh"

242
00:23:53,643 --> 00:23:57,070
"I heard it, and drank it all up"

243
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:09,346
"Come, let's roam around
in the blue skies sometime..."

244
00:24:09,525 --> 00:24:19,598
"If we find a speck of cloud by chance,
let's shower it on earth"

245
00:24:19,969 --> 00:24:30,444
"Your ear-ring is quivering...
somewhere morning has broken"

246
00:24:30,445 --> 00:24:35,944
"Somewhere evening has fallen"

247
00:24:56,705 --> 00:25:06,642
"In the shelter of your hair,
we will spend the night"

248
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:17,152
"Your jet-black eyes
hold a glint in them"

249
00:25:17,727 --> 00:25:28,267
"In exchange for a smile from you
take this earth of mine..."

250
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:32,907
"And this sky too"

251
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:37,338
"Oh dear friend..."

252
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:47,678
"Your soft, lilting laughter...
dear, dear friend..."

253
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,519
"I heard it, and drank it all up"

254
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:59,467
"Snow has fallen in the valley..."

255
00:25:59,468 --> 00:26:04,739
"Cuddled in white woolen"

256
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:10,178
"Snow has fallen in the valley,
and your laughter hummed through it"

257
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:12,514
"Cuddled in wool..."

258
00:26:12,515 --> 00:26:15,249
"Talk and words come out as vapor"

259
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:20,454
"Hot, steaming vapor...
yet soft and gentle"

260
00:26:38,507 --> 00:26:39,641
Who's speaking?

261
00:26:39,642 --> 00:26:41,742
Tell him: Call Suhani
from no. 105

262
00:26:41,743 --> 00:26:44,345
Call Suhani from No. 105.

263
00:26:44,346 --> 00:26:46,815
Who's that? - This is Pinky.

264
00:26:46,816 --> 00:26:49,784
Pinky? - He asks Pinky, who?

265
00:26:49,785 --> 00:26:51,353
Tell him her friend's sister.

266
00:26:51,354 --> 00:26:54,288
Tell him her friend's sister.

267
00:26:54,289 --> 00:26:55,789
What work do you have with her?

268
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,991
Uncle wants to talk to her.

269
00:26:56,992 --> 00:27:01,423
Brat. Say what I say.
- Brat, say what I say.

270
00:27:03,633 --> 00:27:06,567
You shouldn't talk like that.

271
00:27:06,568 --> 00:27:09,069
Say, go and tell Suhani...
that there is a call for her.

272
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,373
Why are you abusing the kid?

273
00:27:11,374 --> 00:27:13,374
I am not abusing her, madam.
He is my nephew.

274
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:14,041
Give me the phone.

275
00:27:14,042 --> 00:27:17,345
Uncle, my ten rupees.
You promised me.

276
00:27:17,346 --> 00:27:19,713
Here. Now, run away.

277
00:27:19,714 --> 00:27:23,348
Hi Jeevan Uncle, whose phone is it?
- It's some friend's, uncle.

278
00:27:25,387 --> 00:27:28,856
Suhani? - You! Where did you get
my number from?

279
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:31,593
Listen, I have something to tell you.
- What?

280
00:27:31,594 --> 00:27:32,993
Tomorrow there is a function
at our house.

281
00:27:32,994 --> 00:27:34,962
Be here sharp at 9 am.

282
00:27:34,963 --> 00:27:36,564
Me? Why me?

283
00:27:36,565 --> 00:27:40,994
Why? Because you sing very well.
- So what?

284
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:45,140
Look, I am not asking you to come
with me to Khandala, am I?

285
00:27:45,141 --> 00:27:48,509
I'm only asking you to come
for our family function.

286
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:52,012
But, why should I come
to your house?

287
00:27:52,013 --> 00:27:54,816
Because if you don't come
to my house,

288
00:27:54,817 --> 00:27:56,651
I will bring everyone
to your house.

289
00:27:56,652 --> 00:27:59,421
You are mad.
You've totally lost it.

290
00:27:59,422 --> 00:28:01,756
I am mad for you.

291
00:28:01,757 --> 00:28:03,591
At least write down the address
of my mad house.

292
00:28:03,592 --> 00:28:06,661
63, Silverine. - Listen.

293
00:28:06,662 --> 00:28:07,695
At least listen to me.

294
00:28:07,696 --> 00:28:10,397
OK, do you know Worli dairy?
Take a 'u-turn' from there...

295
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:14,499
Close to it is a garden,
our house is just next to that.

296
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:33,181
Adi? Who's this Adi in our house?

297
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:44,098
"Looking into my eyes..."
"meeting my gaze..."

298
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:54,075
"Looking into my eyes, betrayal and
deceit he gave me..."

299
00:28:54,076 --> 00:29:00,109
"He held me captive
in his eyes"

300
00:29:07,356 --> 00:29:21,366
"I lost all sense of myself.
I was in a trance..."

301
00:29:33,816 --> 00:29:46,425
"He sure had cast a spell on me..."
"with a mere touch"

302
00:29:47,395 --> 00:29:53,367
"Deceit and betrayal is what I saw him
overflowing with..."

303
00:29:53,368 --> 00:30:03,076
"When he looked into my eyes..."
"when he looked into my eyes"

304
00:30:03,077 --> 00:30:09,613
"He held me captive in his eyes"

305
00:30:11,921 --> 00:30:12,987
Who are those girls?

306
00:30:12,988 --> 00:30:15,155
She's the one I am going to marry.

307
00:30:15,156 --> 00:30:16,024
Which one?

308
00:30:16,025 --> 00:30:19,794
That one in the cream sari.

309
00:30:19,795 --> 00:30:22,830
Adi, are you really going to
marry that girl?

310
00:30:22,831 --> 00:30:25,532
Absolutely aunty. So far
we haven't fixed a date...

311
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:27,935
But, once it's fixed.
You will be the first to know.

312
00:30:27,936 --> 00:30:32,207
Adi's marriage has been finalized.

313
00:30:32,208 --> 00:30:35,543
Adi's engagement has been fixed.
She's Adi's fiancée.

314
00:30:35,544 --> 00:30:38,813
Congratulations. - Congratulations.

315
00:30:38,814 --> 00:30:42,549
You didn't tell us Aditya's marriage
has been fixed.

316
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:45,385
Who's, what has been fixed?
- Adi's... Marriage.

317
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:49,891
Really. With whom?
- With that girl.

318
00:30:49,892 --> 00:30:52,160
The one in the cream sari.

319
00:30:52,161 --> 00:30:54,729
Congratulations to you also.

320
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:57,065
She won't ask for any dowry,
I hope...

321
00:30:57,066 --> 00:30:59,901
You are very amusing.

322
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:00,567
Yes.

323
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:04,172
Who's that?

324
00:31:04,173 --> 00:31:06,140
I don't know.
- What do you mean?

325
00:31:06,141 --> 00:31:08,175
Why did you say that
I am going to marry you?

326
00:31:08,176 --> 00:31:11,144
When did I say that
you are marrying me?

327
00:31:11,145 --> 00:31:17,346
I only said that
I am marrying you.

328
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,621
Did you ask me?

329
00:31:19,622 --> 00:31:22,489
How can I? That is the work
of the elders in a family.

330
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:26,021
But if you are insisting, why don't I
ask you? Will you...? - Very Good.

331
00:31:27,328 --> 00:31:29,063
Then tomorrow morning, I'll send mom
and dad over to your place...

332
00:31:29,064 --> 00:31:30,964
Everything can be finalized there.

333
00:31:30,965 --> 00:31:32,599
Why would I want to marry you?

334
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,435
No no no. You should ask,
why would I want to marry you?

335
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:39,774
Why?

336
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:41,276
Because...

337
00:31:41,277 --> 00:31:43,944
What?

338
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:48,370
Should I...?

339
00:31:55,523 --> 00:31:57,759
What is that?

340
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,389
What do you mean? - Yes

341
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,300
What do you mean...
- What do you mean...?

342
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:10,070
I love you... it means
I can do anything for you.

343
00:32:10,071 --> 00:32:12,472
Can you jump from the
train for me?

344
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:15,009
Sure. As soon as it stops,
I'll jump off.

345
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:20,333
And as soon as you jump,
I'll marry.

346
00:32:28,656 --> 00:32:30,892
It's simple.
Do you like him or not?

347
00:32:30,893 --> 00:32:33,928
My final exams are approaching,
and then I have to intern.

348
00:32:33,929 --> 00:32:36,998
And I have to prepare for my M.D.,
as well. I don't know.

349
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:39,733
But answer me.
Do you like him or not?

350
00:32:39,734 --> 00:32:44,267
How can I? Before me, you have to
get married... we'll see after that.

351
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:48,576
Give me a straight, yes or no.
- No.

352
00:32:48,577 --> 00:32:52,335
Alright, then, My way is clear.
Don't blame me later.

353
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:53,448
What do you mean?

354
00:32:53,449 --> 00:32:55,583
Meaning, you don't like him
but I like him a lot.

355
00:32:55,584 --> 00:33:00,220
What do you mean by that?
- Simple. L-like-him-a-lot.

356
00:33:00,221 --> 00:33:06,717
So, you want to have your cake
and eat it too.

357
00:33:07,596 --> 00:33:12,663
Dad, if there is a proposal from a
rich family, what would you do?

358
00:33:12,934 --> 00:33:16,069
What?
- What are you muttering?

359
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:19,606
I am just asking.
If there is a proposal then...

360
00:33:19,607 --> 00:33:23,111
What sort of a proposal?
- Obviously a marriage proposal.

361
00:33:23,112 --> 00:33:25,512
Now, someone isn't gong to come
and get a rakhi tied from you.

362
00:33:25,513 --> 00:33:27,714
If she is saying something,
let her finish it.

363
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:30,518
Dina, stop throwing the trump card.

364
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:35,722
I got a jack,
so I am throwing a jack.

365
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:39,393
Excuse me. I have to study.

366
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:41,395
It's your turn. - Yes.

367
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:45,223
A family is going to come with
a marriage proposal...

368
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,604
Not for me, for Suhani.
- All right, but who is it?

369
00:33:49,605 --> 00:33:54,875
A barrister... his son is Aditya.

370
00:33:54,876 --> 00:33:58,635
No one has sent any word.
They won't just land up just like that?

371
00:33:59,314 --> 00:34:02,316
That's what I am doing.
Informing you.

372
00:34:02,317 --> 00:34:05,853
Is this why we pawned our jewellery
and sent you to college?

373
00:34:05,854 --> 00:34:08,222
Did we sent you to
college for this?

374
00:34:08,223 --> 00:34:09,856
Mom, I haven't done anything.

375
00:34:09,857 --> 00:34:12,193
Neither am I marrying... nor have I asked
anyone to come with a proposal.

376
00:34:12,194 --> 00:34:15,128
If someone wants to pile on,
what can I do?

377
00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:16,530
You must have done something.

378
00:34:16,531 --> 00:34:21,663
Otherwise no one piles on
just like that.

379
00:34:47,962 --> 00:34:49,162
Please, come in.

380
00:34:49,163 --> 00:34:51,465
Barrister Om Sehgal.
Your bell is probably not working.

381
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:53,467
That's why, I had to use my hands.

382
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:59,362
I did call the electrician,
but he hasn't shown up.

383
00:34:59,807 --> 00:35:03,978
How do you do?
- How do you do?

384
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:07,849
Please, come this way...

385
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,316
I hope you didn't have a problem
finding the house?

386
00:35:09,317 --> 00:35:12,987
It was a bit of problem.
All these houses look so alike...

387
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:15,490
Like compartments of a train.
After all, it is a railway colony.

388
00:35:15,491 --> 00:35:17,791
He loves to joke.

389
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:19,827
All middle class houses
look alike.

390
00:35:19,828 --> 00:35:23,585
Maybe you have never seen them...
Come Suhani.

391
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:30,232
Sir, these are my daughters.
Dina and Suhani. Come in... Sit.

392
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:36,203
Both of them sing very beautifully.
I've heard them when they came home.

393
00:35:36,678 --> 00:35:40,047
Really?

394
00:35:40,048 --> 00:35:43,451
They've been brewing
their own broth quietly.

395
00:35:43,452 --> 00:35:45,820
Times and customs are changing.

396
00:35:45,821 --> 00:35:49,523
Parents today are just figureheads...
to endorse the wishes of their children.

397
00:35:49,524 --> 00:35:51,958
These children do as they please, we no
longer have a say in anything.

398
00:35:51,959 --> 00:35:54,728
Now, I told Aditya that I agree
that it's my money...

399
00:35:54,729 --> 00:35:59,023
But the lungs are yours,
but where will he quit smoking?

400
00:36:00,903 --> 00:36:03,905
By the way, between these two
which one is the one Aditya wants...

401
00:36:03,906 --> 00:36:05,873
He is very forgetful by nature.

402
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:07,708
If I happen to overstay...
at my parent's house.

403
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:10,144
He'll ask me at the door
"Who are you?"

404
00:36:10,145 --> 00:36:12,313
"Whom do you wish to see?"

405
00:36:12,314 --> 00:36:14,548
Quite an entertaining man.

406
00:36:14,549 --> 00:36:18,552
He must keep everyone
occupied at home.

407
00:36:18,553 --> 00:36:21,889
Why don't you get some tea
for everyone?

408
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:23,423
Suhani is the younger one.

409
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,760
She and Adi are in love
with each other.

410
00:36:25,761 --> 00:36:29,087
And the elder?
- Dina is the elder one.

411
00:36:29,163 --> 00:36:31,431
She isn't married yet.
- Why?

412
00:36:31,432 --> 00:36:35,036
Is she waiting for someone
who won't ask for dowry?

413
00:36:35,037 --> 00:36:37,405
You are quite rude,

414
00:36:37,406 --> 00:36:39,539
Sir, What do you think
my daughters are?

415
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:43,174
We might be poor, but we've brought
them up like princesses.

416
00:36:43,544 --> 00:36:46,780
Please don't misunderstand me.
I was saying it's good...

417
00:36:46,781 --> 00:36:50,346
That the girl's parents don't have to
worry about dowry now.

418
00:36:50,419 --> 00:36:53,753
Anyway we don't expect anything...
from you.

419
00:36:53,754 --> 00:36:55,956
No, if you have any expectations,
do tell us.

420
00:36:55,957 --> 00:36:57,358
What expectations
can we have from you?

421
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:58,358
We don't have any from
our own son.

422
00:36:58,359 --> 00:36:59,927
We've given him good education...
that's enough.

423
00:36:59,928 --> 00:37:01,161
He's an adult now.

424
00:37:01,162 --> 00:37:02,929
If he even picks up someone
from the street...

425
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:03,764
We cannot do anything about it.

426
00:37:03,765 --> 00:37:05,398
One minute.

427
00:37:05,399 --> 00:37:08,936
Do you think we are auctioning
our daughters on the roadside...

428
00:37:08,937 --> 00:37:10,503
For the first available groom?

429
00:37:10,504 --> 00:37:13,139
Dad, what are you saying?
- You keep quiet.

430
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,476
Mr. Advocate here can argue with
a magistrate...

431
00:37:15,477 --> 00:37:17,244
But he does not know the courtesies
to talk to his in-laws to be.

432
00:37:17,245 --> 00:37:19,614
You are unnecessarily
twisting the issue.

433
00:37:19,615 --> 00:37:23,351
I did not mean that at all.
- There is nothing more to be said.

434
00:37:23,952 --> 00:37:26,720
We do not want to marry our daughter
in your family.

435
00:37:26,721 --> 00:37:29,856
What has happened hasn't happened with
either your consent or mine.

436
00:37:29,857 --> 00:37:33,558
Let it be, this is no time
for sweets, let's go.

437
00:37:33,962 --> 00:37:39,592
I'm glad we're under
no obligations.

438
00:37:48,209 --> 00:37:52,345
Suhani... Listen...
What happened?

439
00:37:52,346 --> 00:37:57,242
What had to happen has happened.
Let's finish this right here.

440
00:37:57,352 --> 00:37:59,353
Dad went to meet your father.
What happened?

441
00:37:59,354 --> 00:38:02,590
Yes, they met.
Like Musharraf met Vajpayee.

442
00:38:02,591 --> 00:38:06,027
It was like reliving the Agra summit.
- This marriage is not between...

443
00:38:06,028 --> 00:38:08,262
A Prime Minister and a President for the
decision to be taken in Parliament.

444
00:38:08,263 --> 00:38:10,197
We have to marry.
It's for us to decide.

445
00:38:10,198 --> 00:38:12,599
What will we decide?

446
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,068
By seeking their permission...
we showed them our respect.

447
00:38:15,069 --> 00:38:17,505
The respect we got... from your
father is more than enough.

448
00:38:17,506 --> 00:38:18,606
We don't want anymore.

449
00:38:18,607 --> 00:38:20,574
So, my love for you comes
to nothing?

450
00:38:20,575 --> 00:38:23,376
How long have you known me?
20 weeks?

451
00:38:23,377 --> 00:38:25,579
They have nurtured me for 20 years.

452
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,981
I cannot leave them for you.

453
00:38:27,982 --> 00:38:32,186
Suhani, I can leave everything
for you. Everything.

454
00:38:32,187 --> 00:38:34,387
Today, you can leave
everything for me...

455
00:38:34,388 --> 00:38:37,757
What is the guarantee that tomorrow you
will not leave me for another girl?

456
00:38:37,758 --> 00:38:38,592
What is this inverted logic?

457
00:38:38,593 --> 00:38:41,262
In the end... why do I have to
be the scapegoat?

458
00:38:41,263 --> 00:38:43,364
Why are you making a mountain...
out of a molehill?

459
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:45,699
You saw me, chased me,
professed your love...

460
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,936
That's all. What if I had refused you
right in the beginning?

461
00:38:48,937 --> 00:38:50,438
Then, I would have called it
your bad luck.

462
00:38:50,439 --> 00:38:54,108
So, do that now.

463
00:38:54,109 --> 00:38:55,943
Ok... ok... you were right
and I was wrong.

464
00:38:55,944 --> 00:38:59,179
At least listen to me, Suhani.
Please. Just one minute.

465
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:04,485
See, what is the hurry to decide?
Give it some time.

466
00:39:04,486 --> 00:39:07,621
10 days... Only one week...
till the 15th.

467
00:39:07,622 --> 00:39:09,023
Think about it.
If you still think that...

468
00:39:09,024 --> 00:39:14,628
How will one week change anything?
Just leave it.

469
00:39:14,629 --> 00:39:18,592
Give it some time.
Anything can happen. Please.

470
00:39:19,468 --> 00:39:22,469
I might fall in love
with someone else.

471
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:28,239
You love me, don't you?

472
00:39:32,013 --> 00:39:39,014
Today 9.50 p. M Marine Lines Station

473
00:39:52,801 --> 00:39:53,833
Going fine, sir.

474
00:39:53,834 --> 00:39:57,935
How is Dr. Suhani?
We never get time to talk to her.

475
00:39:58,073 --> 00:40:01,342
Before it's 5.30, she has already
left the hospital.

476
00:40:01,343 --> 00:40:03,677
Is it?

477
00:40:03,678 --> 00:40:06,847
This evening, I told her to wait for me.
I had some work.

478
00:40:06,848 --> 00:40:09,916
I got delayed by 10 minutes and
she was nowhere to be found.

479
00:40:09,917 --> 00:40:12,019
Sir, I'll talk to you later.

480
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:15,956
What happened? - He doesn't know.

481
00:40:15,957 --> 00:40:19,427
She left the hospital at 5.30.

482
00:40:19,428 --> 00:40:26,219
Call Rajee. She must have gone there.
She's just had a baby.

483
00:40:27,569 --> 00:40:33,306
Hi Adi... long time no see.
You and Suhani don't come over often?

484
00:40:33,575 --> 00:40:34,874
In a day or two.

485
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:38,270
And listen... - Ok, bye.

486
00:40:55,663 --> 00:40:58,565
Aditya, this relationship
is not possible.

487
00:40:58,566 --> 00:41:01,735
Lives don't change in 8 or 10 days.

488
00:41:01,736 --> 00:41:05,039
And I heard that lives
change in a flash.

489
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,943
Mine didn't.

490
00:41:08,944 --> 00:41:11,344
You didn't miss me at all?

491
00:41:11,345 --> 00:41:15,382
No, there was no reason to.

492
00:41:15,383 --> 00:41:19,449
And there is so much to do.
Household chores. Studies.

493
00:41:23,325 --> 00:41:29,820
You want to think again?
- I've thought already.

494
00:41:38,173 --> 00:41:39,940
Always stay like this.

495
00:41:39,941 --> 00:41:42,610
How? Weeping?

496
00:41:42,611 --> 00:41:47,036
Laughing.

497
00:42:11,973 --> 00:42:17,744
How long will you evade it?

498
00:42:17,745 --> 00:42:20,481
...I mean, the train?
How long will you avoid train?

499
00:42:20,482 --> 00:42:26,681
I might even forget,
only if you let me.

500
00:42:44,506 --> 00:42:48,833
Take it easy. It's a computer...
not your grandfather's typewriter.

501
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:52,404
Like Billu, even we'll have our days...
- Who's Billu?

502
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:58,440
Good old Bill Gates, who else?

503
00:43:08,529 --> 00:43:12,065
You should come quickly to take
your calls, especially at night.

504
00:43:12,066 --> 00:43:16,704
Uncle, your phone.

505
00:43:16,705 --> 00:43:21,835
What are you doing?

506
00:43:34,589 --> 00:43:40,949
What's the matter?
Has it got disconnected?

507
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:47,960
Then, why don't you talk?
I am not listening.

508
00:44:05,553 --> 00:44:09,447
Who are you looking for?
- Do you know where Suhani is?

509
00:44:09,758 --> 00:44:13,460
Hadn't you both broken up?

510
00:44:13,461 --> 00:44:15,862
Broken up... yet...
Do you know where she is?

511
00:44:15,863 --> 00:44:19,432
I've been looking for her for many days.
- She's gone.

512
00:44:19,433 --> 00:44:22,269
Gone? - She's gone to the US.

513
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:28,833
US? - No, she has gone on
a Medical camp.

514
00:44:30,944 --> 00:44:32,980
When is she returning?
- In 3 weeks.

515
00:44:32,981 --> 00:44:34,414
3 weeks?

516
00:44:34,415 --> 00:44:39,614
Three weeks is too long, isn't it?

517
00:44:58,973 --> 00:45:00,840
What will you do with 2,000 rupees?

518
00:45:00,841 --> 00:45:02,175
I am going out.

519
00:45:02,176 --> 00:45:04,811
Where? Outside Bombay?

520
00:45:04,812 --> 00:45:08,148
Yes... I'll be back soon.

521
00:45:08,149 --> 00:45:10,016
What if your father finds out...?

522
00:45:10,017 --> 00:45:12,985
Please handle him.

523
00:45:12,986 --> 00:45:16,556
Are you going with Suhani?

524
00:45:16,557 --> 00:45:20,661
To find her.

525
00:45:20,662 --> 00:45:24,420
"The sky was barren"

526
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:31,505
"When I went in search of you,
my dear beloved"

527
00:45:31,506 --> 00:45:37,510
"I walked many miserable miles.

528
00:45:37,511 --> 00:45:40,940
"It's all such a waste"
"It's all a wasteland, so futile..."

529
00:45:51,459 --> 00:46:00,632
"Let me meet my darling...
Let me meet, just once"

530
00:46:11,278 --> 00:46:14,148
"O my dearest one,
I scanned the skies minutely..."

531
00:46:14,149 --> 00:46:19,317
"and plucked the broken stars"

532
00:46:19,754 --> 00:46:25,788
"This starlight till the dawn,
my eyes get no sleep"

533
00:46:50,984 --> 00:46:53,753
"Just to hear your footfall..."

534
00:46:53,754 --> 00:46:59,357
"I have even borne the silence of
the stones and the statues"

535
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:05,092
"I now find only dejection"

536
00:48:30,551 --> 00:48:38,382
"Look at the fate that is
etched on my brow"

537
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:45,623
"Whenever I saw footprints,
I've bowed my head there"

538
00:48:56,144 --> 00:48:59,045
"How many times must
I call out to you?"

539
00:48:59,046 --> 00:49:04,306
"Your name is what
I find everywhere"

540
00:49:32,145 --> 00:49:33,579
Why did you take so long to come?

541
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:37,646
I can't live without you...
not a single day.

542
00:49:37,819 --> 00:49:42,313
Not a moment.

543
00:49:45,225 --> 00:49:48,027
Can you do anything for me?

544
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:52,766
Should I jump off a moving train?

545
00:49:52,767 --> 00:49:57,362
Marry me.

546
00:49:58,872 --> 00:50:01,574
We'll marry and stay
in our own homes.

547
00:50:01,575 --> 00:50:04,211
We won't tell anyone yet.

548
00:50:04,212 --> 00:50:05,746
Not a soul? - No.

549
00:50:05,747 --> 00:50:10,878
When the time is right,
we'll disclose it.

550
00:50:24,598 --> 00:50:27,166
What happened?
What are you thinking?

551
00:50:27,167 --> 00:50:28,467
I am very scared.

552
00:50:28,468 --> 00:50:31,570
Never mind. Then, get married
in a state of scare.

553
00:50:31,571 --> 00:50:34,407
Don't be silly.
I am really scared.

554
00:50:34,408 --> 00:50:37,144
I'll give you one slap
and it will be alright.

555
00:50:37,145 --> 00:50:40,146
I warned you 10 times.
Think before you say yes.

556
00:50:40,147 --> 00:50:44,684
And every time you told me
to shut up.

557
00:50:44,685 --> 00:50:49,188
I'm in a dilemma.

558
00:50:49,189 --> 00:50:52,358
I've thought about this
very seriously.

559
00:50:52,359 --> 00:50:55,262
If I felt it was wrong I would
never let you do it.

560
00:50:55,263 --> 00:51:01,895
Now come on or you'll miss the bus.
Come on.

561
00:51:03,671 --> 00:51:06,072
How come you're wearing
a sari today?

562
00:51:06,073 --> 00:51:07,273
Isn't she looking pretty?

563
00:51:07,274 --> 00:51:08,974
Of course.

564
00:51:08,975 --> 00:51:12,845
But she suddenly looks like, it's time
for her to get married.

565
00:51:12,846 --> 00:51:14,614
Why don't I get her married, then?

566
00:51:14,615 --> 00:51:15,681
Let's hurry up.

567
00:51:15,682 --> 00:51:21,074
We're sure to miss the bus...
We'll go by an auto.

568
00:51:24,524 --> 00:51:26,025
Where are my princesses going
dressed like this?

569
00:51:26,026 --> 00:51:29,862
We are getting late.
- I am glad I met you...

570
00:51:29,863 --> 00:51:33,800
God bless you.

571
00:51:33,801 --> 00:51:38,204
I'm late today.

572
00:51:38,205 --> 00:51:39,472
Adi... which way are you going?

573
00:51:39,473 --> 00:51:41,373
Why don't you carry on...?

574
00:51:41,374 --> 00:51:43,543
Aren't you very late today?

575
00:51:43,544 --> 00:51:45,010
Yes, we were discussing
the Gazdar case.

576
00:51:45,011 --> 00:51:46,512
Where are you going in
such a hurry?

577
00:51:46,513 --> 00:51:48,748
Close by... to meet a friend.

578
00:51:48,749 --> 00:51:50,884
Get in, I'll drop you.
- No, it's OK.

579
00:51:50,885 --> 00:51:55,956
Get in, you'll waste money on
a taxi otherwise. Sit down.

580
00:51:55,957 --> 00:51:59,592
You haven't informed their
parents, have you?

581
00:51:59,593 --> 00:52:02,161
No, just a few college friends.

582
00:52:02,162 --> 00:52:05,989
Very good. I am tired of marrying
couples in the court.

583
00:52:06,234 --> 00:52:08,001
We're crossing the court,
let's cross it fast.

584
00:52:08,002 --> 00:52:11,103
And Mr. Aditya,
what's cooking nowadays?

585
00:52:11,104 --> 00:52:13,139
Nothing at all, dad.

586
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,742
I am aware of everything
that is happening.

587
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,244
What?

588
00:52:17,245 --> 00:52:18,577
You haven't completed
your law studies,

589
00:52:18,578 --> 00:52:19,579
And you've started a
computer business.

590
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,081
Oh, that! - What oh...?

591
00:52:21,082 --> 00:52:22,648
Where will you get the capital from?

592
00:52:22,649 --> 00:52:26,181
The Bank is ready to give a loan.
- Really?

593
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:32,190
Only, if you sign the guarantee...
- Of course. It's your right.

594
00:52:32,426 --> 00:52:35,094
We have a debt to repay to you.
Isn't it our duty?

595
00:52:35,095 --> 00:52:39,362
Where is the groom?

596
00:52:40,066 --> 00:52:44,603
This is going to be interesting.

597
00:52:44,604 --> 00:52:47,541
Aditya, what are you doing
in a temple?

598
00:52:47,542 --> 00:52:52,074
So, this is a temple?
- You don't believe in God.

599
00:52:52,145 --> 00:52:55,846
So, what are you doing here?
You must have a reason.

600
00:52:56,017 --> 00:52:58,751
What can I do, aunty? You have to
come here to get married.

601
00:52:58,752 --> 00:53:02,784
Oh shut up! Anyway, God will
do his justice.

602
00:53:02,957 --> 00:53:09,487
Does he do his justice
in English or in Hindi?

603
00:53:27,948 --> 00:53:31,650
"O beloved..."

604
00:53:31,651 --> 00:53:36,655
"Listen, my darling.
Listen my dearest"

605
00:53:36,656 --> 00:53:43,418
"The moon will stealthily enter
through the window, barefoot"

606
00:53:43,863 --> 00:53:58,442
"Listen, my beloved.
Listen my love"

607
00:54:03,183 --> 00:54:07,882
Now, the fun starts.

608
00:55:04,444 --> 00:55:08,646
My wife has gone and all I am left with
is a receipt for our marriage.

609
00:55:10,484 --> 00:55:14,320
Have patience for a few days.

610
00:55:14,321 --> 00:55:19,081
How many days? ...4... 5... 6...?

611
00:55:19,926 --> 00:55:23,788
First, let Dina get married at least.
- Then, ask her to get married.

612
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:27,766
Why don't we get her married
next week itself?

613
00:55:27,767 --> 00:55:29,969
First, let me finish my internship
and in the meanwhile...

614
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:34,000
You must establish your business.
- You are being so cold.

615
00:55:34,341 --> 00:55:37,873
Do you know today is
our nuptial night?

616
00:55:39,403 --> 00:55:42,672
Can we meet somewhere?

617
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:45,074
Right now, I am at
Jeevan uncle's stores...

618
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:50,834
Asking the rates for food grains.
- You are so unromantic. So unromantic!

619
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:58,887
What good night?

620
00:55:58,888 --> 00:56:05,484
All alone...
It's a lonely night.

621
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:16,704
Remove your hand.
People are watching. - So what?

622
00:56:16,705 --> 00:56:19,841
You are my legal wife.
Here's the certificate.

623
00:56:19,842 --> 00:56:24,011
Why are you carrying this around?
- What can I do?

624
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:28,850
This is the only substitute I have.

625
00:56:28,851 --> 00:56:30,485
Why are you going on and on with wife?
Wife...? Take off your hand.

626
00:56:30,486 --> 00:56:35,850
Is she your wife?
- No, she is my life.

627
00:56:36,325 --> 00:56:41,761
Sit properly.
This is a public bus.

628
00:56:41,762 --> 00:56:46,194
Are you married?
- Yes, since 15 years.

629
00:56:47,069 --> 00:56:49,338
I pity your husband.

630
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:53,935
Nothing...d

631
00:56:54,977 --> 00:57:01,440
Suhani, there is a call for you.

632
00:57:14,363 --> 00:57:15,029
What is it?

633
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:18,166
I told you I love you.
- I know.

634
00:57:18,167 --> 00:57:20,868
Then, you should also know that
we both have the same address.

635
00:57:20,869 --> 00:57:26,837
Yet, we are both so far.
Tell me, you love me.

636
00:57:28,477 --> 00:57:30,547
Tell the doctor to check
his patients.

637
00:57:30,548 --> 00:57:34,384
I say, hang up...
Sir, it's an emergency case.

638
00:57:34,385 --> 00:57:37,386
We'll have to keep him
in intensive care.

639
00:57:37,387 --> 00:57:42,244
He sounds a little mad.

640
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:49,419
She didn't say it? - Run.

641
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:08,384
Sorry. You had to wait for 2 hours.

642
00:58:08,385 --> 00:58:12,955
To catch a glimpse of you,
I can wait for two lifetimes.

643
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:15,557
I've got to go. - No.

644
00:58:15,558 --> 00:58:21,656
People are coming to see Dina.
- No.

645
00:58:41,416 --> 00:58:45,549
"Come everyday to me
turn the night into a day"

646
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:50,391
"On the sly, under the
sheet of the night"

647
00:58:50,392 --> 00:58:54,650
"Where even the moon can't approach"

648
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:58,329
"Let's go behind a cloud"

649
00:58:58,468 --> 00:59:06,232
"Where every drop pines...
every drop is in turmoil"

650
00:59:07,274 --> 00:59:12,612
"Where time stops still"

651
00:59:12,613 --> 00:59:17,407
"Give us a hug under the
sheet of the night"

652
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:49,448
"In the warmth of the
winter's sunshine"

653
00:59:50,118 --> 00:59:53,819
"Look at me with lowered eyes..."

654
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:58,949
"from behind your hand"

655
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:12,329
"Blow hot and cold. Ever so softly
in the raag Marva"

656
01:00:12,474 --> 01:00:16,837
"Let not the day set.
Nor the night fall"

657
01:00:16,846 --> 01:00:21,344
"Let not the sun set"

658
01:00:21,483 --> 01:00:25,379
"And if it does, let not the
morning break"

659
01:00:25,654 --> 01:00:30,050
"Let the night go on and on..."

660
01:00:47,909 --> 01:00:52,581
"Lying to friends,
in somebody else's name"

661
01:00:52,582 --> 01:01:00,454
"About you and me.
All through the night"

662
01:01:00,455 --> 01:01:05,661
"You're away too long.
It's so difficult..."

663
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:13,232
"to just sign and be contented"

664
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:23,469
"When will the separation end?"

665
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:31,616
"Come every day to me and
turn the night into a day"

666
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:44,526
"Without you, this wind from the east
seems silly"

667
01:01:45,433 --> 01:01:49,067
"It rushed into my scarf'

668
01:01:49,671 --> 01:01:53,839
"You also come and embrace me
like this wind, some day"

669
01:01:54,010 --> 01:02:02,408
"Come and embrace me,
like this wind..."

670
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:07,721
"Listen, dear friend"

671
01:02:07,823 --> 01:02:16,589
"If I can't sleep tomorrow,
call me to you"

672
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:24,168
"Keep my head your lap
and sing me a lullaby"

673
01:02:25,106 --> 01:02:33,873
"Hug me to you under the sheet of the night,
on the sly"

674
01:02:34,149 --> 01:02:41,788
"Where even the moon can't approach.
Behind a cloud"

675
01:02:52,801 --> 01:02:55,103
Dina, unlike me, is not so quiet.

676
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:59,473
She talks a lot.

677
01:02:59,474 --> 01:03:04,270
She knows a lot.

678
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:06,480
Don't go by what she says.

679
01:03:06,481 --> 01:03:10,286
Dina is very simple... very tolerant.

680
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:13,556
She has taken the responsibility
of the entire household and...

681
01:03:13,557 --> 01:03:16,992
...she never complains. Isn't it?

682
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:20,228
In fact, it's the same case
with Raghu.

683
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:25,329
See, he hasn't even opened
his mouth so far.

684
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:31,639
Raghu... say something.
If you say yes...

685
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:36,105
For us everything is alright... Why?
- I am agreeable too.

686
01:03:37,144 --> 01:03:43,646
But, you should ask Dina as well.
- Don't worry about that.

687
01:03:43,787 --> 01:03:47,146
We called you only
when Dina said yes.

688
01:03:48,423 --> 01:03:51,091
When you give your consent...

689
01:03:51,092 --> 01:03:54,194
We'll get an auspicious date fixed.

690
01:03:54,195 --> 01:03:58,558
And you've told that you're
not superstitious.

691
01:03:59,868 --> 01:04:04,663
Can I say something
if you don't mind...?

692
01:04:05,707 --> 01:04:09,877
Your younger daughter and my younger son
are both studying medicine.

693
01:04:09,878 --> 01:04:11,012
What's it called?

694
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:13,447
Bio-Technology.
- Yes, Bio-Technology.

695
01:04:13,448 --> 01:04:18,584
He's doing a Masters degree.
We haven't asked Kartik, but...

696
01:04:18,689 --> 01:04:22,023
We'll ask him and
you ask your daughter.

697
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:25,527
If they agree then, its God's will.
Both brothers and sisters...

698
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:30,489
Can stay in the same house.

699
01:04:31,298 --> 01:04:34,134
What are you saying, mom?
How can this be?

700
01:04:34,135 --> 01:04:37,505
If it can, what's wrong with it?

701
01:04:37,506 --> 01:04:39,572
It's like a yard sale.
Buy one, get one free.

702
01:04:39,573 --> 01:04:45,244
We are not selling our daughters.
They haven't even asked for a dowry.

703
01:04:45,245 --> 01:04:49,384
The boy is well educated.
This is a stroke of good fortune.

704
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:53,822
Why are you attaching my fortune with his?
- Speak softly.

705
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:56,759
Wear this. - What's wrong in
what I am wearing?

706
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,927
I won't do it.
Mom, I cannot marry.

707
01:04:59,928 --> 01:05:03,959
It seems you're going to ruin
Dina's fortune. Wear this.

708
01:05:09,837 --> 01:05:15,110
She got scared hearing about
her marriage.

709
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:17,744
Even, I'd gotten scared.

710
01:05:17,745 --> 01:05:21,709
If I had any inclination that something
like this would happen,

711
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:23,716
I surely wouldn't have come.

712
01:05:23,717 --> 01:05:29,719
But, that's how my father is.

713
01:05:36,096 --> 01:05:42,037
Are you OK with it?

714
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:46,502
I am already married.

715
01:05:57,452 --> 01:06:04,123
My parents don't know.
I married secretly in the court.

716
01:06:44,332 --> 01:06:48,123
11.30 PM, Marine Lines Station.

717
01:07:18,363 --> 01:07:21,725
Railway Colony, Mumbai.

718
01:07:24,614 --> 01:07:26,348
Is Suhani here?

719
01:07:26,349 --> 01:07:31,212
There is no one by that name here.
Get lost.

720
01:07:40,562 --> 01:07:45,295
Where is Suhani?

721
01:07:57,413 --> 01:08:00,647
Where is Suhani?

722
01:08:00,648 --> 01:08:07,045
Where is Dina?
- She's not at home.

723
01:08:09,192 --> 01:08:11,360
I am asking you to tell me
where Suhani is.

724
01:08:11,361 --> 01:08:16,059
What's happened to her?

725
01:08:17,567 --> 01:08:22,104
I don't know.

726
01:08:22,105 --> 01:08:27,805
She left the hospital at 5.

727
01:08:27,875 --> 01:08:31,703
It's 11 now...
there is no news of her.

728
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:39,045
I've gone home twice.
There is no news of her.

729
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:42,855
So, where has she gone?
You must have said something to her.

730
01:08:54,903 --> 01:08:58,732
22 years. Height 5 feet.
- And 2 inches!

731
01:08:59,241 --> 01:09:04,478
Height 5 feet 2 inches.
Wearing a light brown Sari.

732
01:09:05,514 --> 01:09:10,251
A doctor's coat, hand bag,
stethoscope.

733
01:09:10,317 --> 01:09:13,720
Sir, there is a hospital
ID card as well.

734
01:09:13,721 --> 01:09:21,452
Hospital ID-card. Yes, just check
and call me.

735
01:09:42,951 --> 01:09:45,254
Uncle, are you going? - Yes.

736
01:09:45,255 --> 01:09:50,617
Leaving home and going away?
- Yes.

737
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:18,286
She's the one who should cry,

738
01:10:18,287 --> 01:10:20,490
whose marriage you have broken.

739
01:10:20,491 --> 01:10:22,490
I don't want to marry.

740
01:10:22,491 --> 01:10:24,724
Yes, why would you want to marry?

741
01:10:24,725 --> 01:10:26,960
She is the one in a hurry
to get married.

742
01:10:26,961 --> 01:10:30,721
The elder one is still unmarried and
the younger one has no patience.

743
01:10:31,933 --> 01:10:36,001
In six months she'll be abandoned
and be on the streets.

744
01:10:41,942 --> 01:10:45,815
Get lost. There is no place for
you in this house.

745
01:10:45,816 --> 01:10:48,249
Be sensitive,
he's leaving the house.

746
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:52,645
Whose house? When was this his house?
This is my house.

747
01:10:52,755 --> 01:10:55,825
Aditya, don't go away.

748
01:10:55,826 --> 01:10:58,291
Anyone who is stopping him
can leave with him as well.

749
01:10:58,292 --> 01:11:02,617
Get out.

750
01:11:24,451 --> 01:11:28,809
Let it be.

751
01:11:33,595 --> 01:11:38,658
Get out of my house.

752
01:11:58,955 --> 01:12:02,258
From this day, we will have
no dealings with this house.

753
01:12:02,259 --> 01:12:05,992
Promise me. We'll never show
our face to them again.

754
01:12:06,696 --> 01:12:09,330
We both are enough for each other.
- OK.

755
01:12:09,331 --> 01:12:10,897
Take me to the temple.

756
01:12:10,898 --> 01:12:14,168
Why? Do you want to marry again?
- Shut up and get in.

757
01:12:14,169 --> 01:12:20,097
Okay, let's go.

758
01:12:27,818 --> 01:12:33,576
We carry the burdens of the world
on our heads.

759
01:12:33,589 --> 01:12:37,220
What are you doing? Be careful.
- Thank you. At least you noticed.

760
01:12:37,658 --> 01:12:39,695
The stove is a gift from me.
Buy yourself your own gas.

761
01:12:39,696 --> 01:12:44,330
I can gift you a matchbox.

762
01:12:44,331 --> 01:12:47,135
What is all this?
- It belongs to my brother.

763
01:12:47,136 --> 01:12:48,235
Does he drink here?

764
01:12:48,236 --> 01:12:50,638
All this will get shifted inside.
He'll drink in his section.

765
01:12:50,639 --> 01:12:54,141
This part of the house
belongs to you.

766
01:12:54,142 --> 01:12:57,977
Hey kids! There is a great advantage
in eloping with a girl.

767
01:12:57,978 --> 01:13:01,978
The girl doesn't threaten to go back
to her parents every now and then.

768
01:13:02,017 --> 01:13:05,888
That is true.
She won't threaten.

769
01:13:05,889 --> 01:13:09,920
Yes, but there is also a problem.
- What's that?

770
01:13:10,158 --> 01:13:12,226
Eloping with girls...
will become a habit and...

771
01:13:12,227 --> 01:13:14,561
He'll keep running away
with all and sundry.

772
01:13:14,562 --> 01:13:16,830
Did you weigh your profits and losses
when you eloped with aunty?

773
01:13:16,831 --> 01:13:19,333
No, no. It was she who
made me run away.

774
01:13:19,334 --> 01:13:21,637
Really? How did that happen?

775
01:13:21,638 --> 01:13:24,705
I'd had a bit too much to drink.
I got emotional.

776
01:13:24,706 --> 01:13:28,305
Let's go.
- There is some left...

777
01:13:31,214 --> 01:13:34,013
What's the matter.
You seem to be very happy.

778
01:13:34,014 --> 01:13:38,646
Excited?

779
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:01,833
"Soaring..."
"Are my dreams"

780
01:14:02,178 --> 01:14:07,109
"my heart dreams...
of colourful nights"

781
01:14:25,834 --> 01:14:30,606
"The light mist that
descended last night..."

782
01:14:30,607 --> 01:14:33,108
"left my eyes brimming..."

783
01:14:33,109 --> 01:14:36,244
"as it pattered on my hands"

784
01:14:36,245 --> 01:14:41,037
"The joy of getting drenched in the
first rains of the season"

785
01:14:41,684 --> 01:14:43,985
"I was drenched in the first rains,
without a regret..."

786
01:14:43,986 --> 01:14:53,717
"all over town, without a regret"

787
01:14:54,728 --> 01:14:57,232
"Like her plaits in knots,
coming free..."

788
01:14:57,233 --> 01:14:59,701
"it poured all night"

789
01:14:59,702 --> 01:15:02,138
"At times, coaxing.
At times, tormenting..."

790
01:15:02,139 --> 01:15:08,461
"like the moods of my beloved"

791
01:15:26,630 --> 01:15:31,831
"When I tease her out of love,
sometimes... she sulks"

792
01:15:31,832 --> 01:15:34,503
"Even when I let go in
a fit of anger,

793
01:15:34,504 --> 01:15:40,771
"I have a battle on my hands"

794
01:15:42,245 --> 01:15:47,183
"Even if I simply kiss her,
I still have a battle to cope with"

795
01:15:47,184 --> 01:15:52,388
"The light of my eyes
means the life to me..."

796
01:15:52,389 --> 01:16:02,220
"in my eyes I preserve this life,
it's only for you..."

797
01:16:45,341 --> 01:16:50,271
"Few are the moments of life
to spend them in disagreement"

798
01:16:50,446 --> 01:16:55,375
"I have been through death to put
our fragile hearts together"

799
01:16:55,751 --> 01:17:00,987
"Ask for anything and
I can present it to you"

800
01:17:00,988 --> 01:17:05,927
"But, do consider... there are very
few stars in the sky anyway"

801
01:17:05,928 --> 01:17:10,996
"The light of my eyes
means the life to me..."

802
01:17:11,198 --> 01:17:15,936
"even though my eyes have often
seen a sweet bitterness..."

803
01:17:15,937 --> 01:17:20,969
"this life, this life of mine..."

804
01:17:21,209 --> 01:17:22,945
"without a regret..."

805
01:17:22,946 --> 01:17:30,880
"all over town, without regret,
only for you"

806
01:17:31,654 --> 01:17:34,455
"Like her plaits in knots,
coming free..."

807
01:17:34,456 --> 01:17:36,925
"it poured all night"

808
01:17:36,926 --> 01:17:42,255
"Coaxing, tormenting...
like the moods of my beloved"

809
01:17:42,429 --> 01:17:44,799
"Soaring..."

810
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,369
"are my dreams"

811
01:17:47,370 --> 01:17:52,333
"my heart dreams...
of colourful nights"

812
01:18:17,366 --> 01:18:23,293
Don't see through your right eye.
It's inauspicious.

813
01:18:23,839 --> 01:18:25,205
Where is the newspaper?

814
01:18:25,206 --> 01:18:27,675
I have been waiting for 15 minutes.

815
01:18:27,676 --> 01:18:29,244
Hoping that when you get up...
you will see me first.

816
01:18:29,245 --> 01:18:34,013
And all you want is the paper.

817
01:18:34,014 --> 01:18:36,583
OK, I've seen you.
Now, where is the paper?

818
01:18:36,584 --> 01:18:39,686
At night you were making many promises.
What happened now?

819
01:18:39,687 --> 01:18:43,956
Really? What was I saying?
- Liar.

820
01:18:43,957 --> 01:18:45,193
You aren't worried about your wife

821
01:18:45,194 --> 01:18:48,129
But, you want to know...
what's happening in Patna.

822
01:18:48,130 --> 01:18:50,563
Please give me the paper.
- You won't get it.

823
01:18:50,564 --> 01:18:53,032
You can't get your wife and
the news together.

824
01:18:53,033 --> 01:18:56,905
Suhani, where's the paper?

825
01:18:56,906 --> 01:19:03,368
But, what's happened in Patna?
- Riots have broken out.

826
01:19:06,715 --> 01:19:07,482
Where is the paper?

827
01:19:07,483 --> 01:19:11,478
Here's your hot news.
- What madness is this?

828
01:19:11,955 --> 01:19:15,321
Hey kids! What's going on?
- Nothing.

829
01:19:15,322 --> 01:19:19,217
Why are you burning the house?
All this won't do in someone else's house.

830
01:19:19,328 --> 01:19:22,798
But, this is my house...
- How's it your own house...?

831
01:19:22,799 --> 01:19:26,434
That will happen when you pay the rent.
What did you tell Pushy?

832
01:19:26,435 --> 01:19:28,302
That you'd pay 5 months rent
in advance. Where is it?

833
01:19:28,303 --> 01:19:32,974
I said on the 1st... - The 1st went by
long ago. What's the date today?

834
01:19:32,975 --> 01:19:37,311
No, I meant the 1st of next month.
- Uncle, the tea is getting cold.

835
01:19:37,312 --> 01:19:39,379
Do you want to mix it?

836
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:44,448
In front of this girl,
I cannot argue.

837
01:19:44,687 --> 01:19:48,254
Poor thing has left her parents house.
- And poor me.

838
01:19:48,255 --> 01:19:51,192
Even I have left my parents house.
- Left the house...?

839
01:19:51,193 --> 01:19:57,091
You must have been thrown out.
- Uncle, have your tea.

840
01:19:57,631 --> 01:20:01,302
Meera, what happened to
that Sintel file?

841
01:20:01,303 --> 01:20:04,272
Bhaskar is working on
some more details.

842
01:20:04,273 --> 01:20:06,442
Are you people following it up
properly or not?

843
01:20:06,443 --> 01:20:09,909
Of course we are. But, there has been
no response from their side.

844
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:11,477
But, what is the problem?

845
01:20:11,478 --> 01:20:14,549
Until their American Co-coordinators
don't approve the project...

846
01:20:14,550 --> 01:20:18,286
The deal cannot progress.
- Show me the file.

847
01:20:25,995 --> 01:20:30,322
No. Wrong number.
Some Anil Mehta.

848
01:20:34,504 --> 01:20:35,668
I had gone to buy vegetables.

849
01:20:35,669 --> 01:20:39,237
I've been waiting for you for an hour.
- Sorry.

850
01:20:40,376 --> 01:20:42,643
If you were going to take that long,
you should've left the keys with someone.

851
01:20:42,644 --> 01:20:44,345
With whom? Pushy Aunty?

852
01:20:44,346 --> 01:20:45,347
And what if she'd asked
for the rent?

853
01:20:45,348 --> 01:20:49,485
So, should I just keep sitting...
until her Excellency arrives?

854
01:20:49,486 --> 01:20:52,388
Do you think I went for a stroll?
I had gone to shop for our dinner.

855
01:20:52,389 --> 01:20:56,555
But, what's the idea of making me
sit like a guard?

856
01:20:56,890 --> 01:20:58,427
Why are you splitting hairs?

857
01:20:58,428 --> 01:21:00,896
Before marriage... you could wait for me
for hours at the station.

858
01:21:00,897 --> 01:21:04,630
Did you become a ticket checker
because of that? Come on.

859
01:21:04,631 --> 01:21:08,734
It was another thing then. - What?
How was it different then?

860
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:10,138
Open the door.

861
01:21:10,139 --> 01:21:12,174
We weren't married then... that's why.
- No... yes...

862
01:21:12,175 --> 01:21:14,308
And now we are married. So, you don't
care for me any longer?

863
01:21:14,309 --> 01:21:16,977
When did I say that?
- But, that's what you implied.

864
01:21:16,978 --> 01:21:19,080
Give me the key.

865
01:21:19,081 --> 01:21:19,945
Don't change the topic.

866
01:21:19,946 --> 01:21:22,183
Why don't you say it clearly...
that you don't need me anymore.

867
01:21:22,184 --> 01:21:25,552
Now, why are you splitting hairs?
Give me the keys.

868
01:21:25,553 --> 01:21:26,820
I won't give him any food.

869
01:21:26,821 --> 01:21:31,286
Once he sleeps hungry,
he'll realize.

870
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:35,597
And remember this incident.
- And even you remember this... - What?

871
01:21:35,598 --> 01:21:37,062
Every time you fight with me,

872
01:21:37,063 --> 01:21:39,132
I'll keep on making up
with you like this.

873
01:21:39,133 --> 01:21:42,535
Let go of me. Leave me.

874
01:21:42,536 --> 01:21:43,638
Not right now. Get lost.

875
01:21:43,639 --> 01:21:45,371
That's what you said before
marriage also.

876
01:21:45,372 --> 01:21:51,647
Exactly. Because unlike you,
I've not changed after marriage.

877
01:21:51,648 --> 01:21:53,080
Now, what is this?

878
01:21:53,081 --> 01:21:56,884
The days that you fight with me.
I will mark the calendar. - Why?

879
01:21:56,885 --> 01:21:59,254
To prove that getting married
is very risky business.

880
01:21:59,255 --> 01:22:03,457
That is true. Considering the way
you fight with me at night...

881
01:22:03,625 --> 01:22:06,829
And bite and claw me...
Should I show you the marks?

882
01:22:06,830 --> 01:22:10,897
Do you want to see them?

883
01:22:10,898 --> 01:22:14,430
The mood is pleasant...

884
01:22:15,404 --> 01:22:16,070
What's it?

885
01:22:16,071 --> 01:22:18,304
Are you trying to find me?
I am here.

886
01:22:18,305 --> 01:22:19,840
Where is my mangalsutra?

887
01:22:19,841 --> 01:22:22,409
Forget it, I am alive right here
and ready to be hugged.

888
01:22:22,410 --> 01:22:26,148
You took it out at night
saying it pricks.

889
01:22:29,184 --> 01:22:32,920
I am the symbol of your marriage.
Why don't you hug me?

890
01:22:33,255 --> 01:22:36,692
You prick even more.
Where is my mangalsutra?

891
01:22:36,693 --> 01:22:40,391
Aunty... she'll ask for the rent.
Leave me, you shameless!

892
01:22:46,834 --> 01:22:49,436
How was it last night?
- What?

893
01:22:49,437 --> 01:22:54,610
Dhansak. Did you not eat it?
- Oh that! That was great.

894
01:22:54,611 --> 01:22:56,610
She cleaned up all of it.

895
01:22:56,611 --> 01:22:58,544
Now, you don't even need to
clean the utensils.

896
01:22:58,545 --> 01:23:03,648
Why don't you go and take the recipe
from Aunty this evening?

897
01:23:06,089 --> 01:23:08,821
What is this mangalsutra
doing here?

898
01:23:08,822 --> 01:23:12,322
Suhani, this should not be taken off.
- Yes.

899
01:23:12,526 --> 01:23:13,695
I have been searching for
this all morning.

900
01:23:13,696 --> 01:23:15,294
It has to be your doing.
You must have hidden it.

901
01:23:15,295 --> 01:23:19,367
Why should I hide it?
I thought I should wear it.

902
01:23:19,368 --> 01:23:25,498
Sometimes even the man should
look married.

903
01:23:27,109 --> 01:23:32,170
How much sugar?
- One spoon.

904
01:23:38,919 --> 01:23:42,987
Here comes our friend. Wait and see.
He's going to start a fight.

905
01:23:46,995 --> 01:23:50,397
Wait for a minute.

906
01:23:50,398 --> 01:23:51,433
How are you? - Fine.

907
01:23:51,434 --> 01:23:55,601
Hello wife... how are you? Having tea?
- I'm fine.

908
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:01,465
I'll just be back.

909
01:24:04,212 --> 01:24:09,274
As long as you don't start it.

910
01:24:11,587 --> 01:24:14,912
Suhani, where is my
project report file?

911
01:24:15,822 --> 01:24:20,360
Are you listening to me?
Where is my file?

912
01:24:20,361 --> 01:24:25,331
I've told you so many times...
not to move my things around.

913
01:24:25,332 --> 01:24:32,000
Why are you laughing...?

914
01:24:41,550 --> 01:24:45,686
Please stop it. Don't inject him anymore.
- Suhani, take her out.

915
01:24:45,687 --> 01:24:54,463
Please come with me... come.
- No, I won't go.

916
01:24:54,464 --> 01:25:00,834
Come with me... Let the doctor
try at least.

917
01:25:00,835 --> 01:25:06,698
He's here for the past 2 days...
Nothing has been done.

918
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:23,585
Suhani, what's there to eat?
I am very hungry.

919
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:33,934
What happened?
- Let me stay like this.

920
01:25:33,935 --> 01:25:37,260
Everyone is looking.
- Let them.

921
01:25:40,809 --> 01:25:45,512
What's embarrassing? I am your wife.
Are you embarrassed...

922
01:25:46,214 --> 01:25:49,817
Be reasonable, let's go inside.
- Let your reasons be.

923
01:25:49,818 --> 01:25:56,085
Can you not even ask me
what I've been through?

924
01:25:58,959 --> 01:26:02,830
OK, I am sorry. I didn't know
what happened at the hospital,

925
01:26:02,831 --> 01:26:04,630
I just thought...

926
01:26:04,631 --> 01:26:08,698
Don't touch me.
- Are you an untouchable?

927
01:26:10,103 --> 01:26:13,240
You could always sense
my mood on the phone.

928
01:26:13,241 --> 01:26:15,610
Why are you so restless?

929
01:26:15,611 --> 01:26:20,573
You always knew the minute
you saw me.

930
01:26:20,947 --> 01:26:24,985
You used to call me twice a day
just to know how I was feeling.

931
01:26:24,986 --> 01:26:28,687
Don't you remember?
- I remember.

932
01:26:28,688 --> 01:26:31,058
In spite of living in the same city
and having a phone...

933
01:26:31,059 --> 01:26:34,293
You used to send me telegrams
to cheer me up.

934
01:26:34,294 --> 01:26:37,263
Where did all those things
got vanished?

935
01:26:37,264 --> 01:26:41,034
I am still ready to do all that.
But, when will you grow up?

936
01:26:41,035 --> 01:26:45,295
We aren't college students anymore.

937
01:26:45,505 --> 01:26:49,909
We are responsible for each other.

938
01:26:49,910 --> 01:26:56,007
Do people stop loving
after marriage?

939
01:27:24,178 --> 01:27:27,481
Don't stare like that.

940
01:27:27,482 --> 01:27:31,238
Did you even think of us or try to
find out if we are dead or alive?

941
01:27:32,587 --> 01:27:34,553
Don't speak rudely, mother.

942
01:27:34,554 --> 01:27:40,158
Not one day has passed...
when I've not missed you.

943
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:42,861
You could have come home also.

944
01:27:42,862 --> 01:27:45,166
How could I have?

945
01:27:45,167 --> 01:27:49,871
Don't you remember what you and dad
said when you threw me out.

946
01:27:51,407 --> 01:27:54,072
Your father's tyranny will be
the end of us all.

947
01:27:54,073 --> 01:27:58,469
Lying in the hospital...
- What's happened to dad?

948
01:27:59,848 --> 01:28:01,348
I am not the doctor.

949
01:28:01,349 --> 01:28:06,411
We've got a lot of tests done, but...

950
01:28:07,554 --> 01:28:13,690
These tests are for jaundice.
Mom, I want to see dad.

951
01:28:16,398 --> 01:28:21,930
If you come, he will be pleased.
We have come to call you.

952
01:28:24,071 --> 01:28:27,398
But, don't tell him that we met.

953
01:28:40,022 --> 01:28:42,290
Adi, Suhani is here.

954
01:28:42,291 --> 01:28:47,927
Hi. What happened?
How come you didn't go to work?

955
01:28:47,928 --> 01:28:54,068
Dad is in hospital...
can we go and meet him?

956
01:28:54,069 --> 01:29:00,738
It was you who said that we will
not keep any links with anyone.

957
01:29:01,008 --> 01:29:05,266
Now, what happened?
- Yes, but he is serious.

958
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:09,147
He's in the Railway Hospital.
- Who told you?

959
01:29:09,148 --> 01:29:12,888
He's got jaundice.
He cannot be treated there.

960
01:29:12,889 --> 01:29:19,558
But, who told you? - Mom and Dina.
I met them in the train.

961
01:29:20,928 --> 01:29:24,756
They know where we live
and where I work.

962
01:29:26,868 --> 01:29:30,832
But, they didn't think it necessary
to tell me.

963
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:36,242
It's not that.
Why do you think like that?

964
01:29:36,243 --> 01:29:39,945
I still remember my promise.
But you are forgetting yours.

965
01:29:41,283 --> 01:29:44,746
He spent his entire life's savings
to make me a doctor.

966
01:29:45,654 --> 01:29:47,086
What good is my being a doctor if...a

967
01:29:47,087 --> 01:29:51,791
Dr. Suhani, if your education is
compelling you, then you may go.

968
01:29:52,127 --> 01:29:55,863
Neither am I a doctor nor
am I compelled in any way.

969
01:29:55,864 --> 01:29:58,199
Why are you being indifferent?

970
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:00,867
Other than the two of you...
I have no one.

971
01:30:00,868 --> 01:30:03,505
We are the only ones they have.

972
01:30:03,506 --> 01:30:07,534
Suhani, I have not forgotten
his slap till today.

973
01:30:10,444 --> 01:30:16,439
If you want to go, you may.

974
01:30:41,875 --> 01:30:46,734
How's your father?

975
01:30:46,816 --> 01:30:50,483
How do I know?.

976
01:30:50,484 --> 01:30:52,952
Didn't you go?

977
01:30:52,953 --> 01:30:56,190
How could I? I had promised.

978
01:30:56,191 --> 01:31:00,655
Then, break the promise.
Let's go tomorrow.

979
01:31:01,795 --> 01:31:04,329
What if he says something again?

980
01:31:04,330 --> 01:31:08,737
When I've been slapped by him,
how does a little scolding matter?

981
01:31:08,738 --> 01:31:15,164
Let's go tomorrow.

982
01:31:17,176 --> 01:31:23,517
Behave yourself in front of dad.
And... - I'm wearing this for your dad.

983
01:31:23,518 --> 01:31:27,687
Go fast - I am sorry. I am sorry.
- Take her there quickly.

984
01:31:27,688 --> 01:31:31,118
What...? - Go home.?

985
01:32:05,125 --> 01:32:10,193
Don't touch him.
Let his soul rest in peace.

986
01:32:12,968 --> 01:32:17,601
No child would've given so much
pain to the parents.

987
01:32:18,672 --> 01:32:22,568
Now, take your husband and
leave our house.

988
01:32:23,044 --> 01:32:27,434
Mother...s

989
01:32:53,709 --> 01:32:58,497
Daddy...

990
01:33:25,907 --> 01:33:30,443
All my hopes are now pinned
on the Sintel project.

991
01:33:30,444 --> 01:33:34,271
If we lose that then, we'll
have to close the shop.

992
01:33:35,850 --> 01:33:41,845
With all the overheads...

993
01:33:42,991 --> 01:33:46,625
Now, stop it please.
How long will you keep crying?

994
01:33:48,363 --> 01:33:49,562
It's been so many days.

995
01:33:49,563 --> 01:33:53,425
What should I do if
I feel like crying?

996
01:33:55,636 --> 01:33:59,204
Had I not insisted on marrying,
all this would never have happened.

997
01:33:59,205 --> 01:34:03,704
It was I who had insisted
on marrying secretly.

998
01:34:03,979 --> 01:34:05,345
I was also so impatient.

999
01:34:05,346 --> 01:34:08,449
If you are repenting it.
Why don't you leave me?

1000
01:34:08,450 --> 01:34:09,918
If I can live without my father,

1001
01:34:09,919 --> 01:34:16,243
I can live without you.
Leave me alone.

1002
01:34:26,068 --> 01:34:30,004
What should I say? - Just read what
is written. Come on try, please.

1003
01:34:30,005 --> 01:34:32,540
What if I get caught? Don't worry.
You just have to act a little.

1004
01:34:32,541 --> 01:34:34,641
Anyway, that's all you do
through out the day.

1005
01:34:34,642 --> 01:34:35,543
I'll slap you...

1006
01:34:35,544 --> 01:34:39,213
Hello! This is...
- Like a woman... shyly.

1007
01:34:39,214 --> 01:34:42,643
Dina Sharma.
Do you remember me?

1008
01:34:43,084 --> 01:34:46,285
Mr. Sharma's daughter... Dina?

1009
01:34:46,286 --> 01:34:50,422
Yes, Miss Dina! What a surprise!
How are you?

1010
01:34:50,658 --> 01:34:56,192
I am fine. I wanted to meet you once.
- Me? What for?

1011
01:34:56,598 --> 01:35:00,561
At 4 o'clock near the Kala Ghoda
parking lot...

1012
01:35:00,568 --> 01:35:04,270
Tomorrow.
Don't worry, I won't bite.

1013
01:35:16,285 --> 01:35:21,948
Can you connect me to Dina Sharma?

1014
01:35:25,461 --> 01:35:28,887
Miss Dina. Good morning,
this is Raghunath Pandit.

1015
01:35:29,764 --> 01:35:31,933
Maybe you didn't recognize me...

1016
01:35:31,934 --> 01:35:33,467
I recognize you very well.

1017
01:35:33,468 --> 01:35:35,103
What do you want from me?

1018
01:35:35,104 --> 01:35:36,669
I wanted to meet you.

1019
01:35:36,670 --> 01:35:40,340
Why? Was it not enough to
insult my family?

1020
01:35:40,341 --> 01:35:45,577
That's why... I mean... I want
to remove all doubts.

1021
01:35:45,813 --> 01:35:50,751
If you could meet me for 5 minutes...

1022
01:35:50,752 --> 01:35:53,621
Please... only for 5 minutes.

1023
01:35:53,622 --> 01:35:59,425
If you could meet me tomorrow at 4 P.M.
Near the Kala Ghoda parking lot,

1024
01:35:59,426 --> 01:36:04,091
I would be grateful.

1025
01:36:33,527 --> 01:36:37,165
Isn't that Raghu?
- It sure looks like him.

1026
01:36:37,166 --> 01:36:39,766
We were totally ruined after
that incident.

1027
01:36:39,767 --> 01:36:44,704
Dad passed away soon after.
But, why should it concern you... you...

1028
01:36:44,705 --> 01:36:48,966
I am sorry for what has happened.

1029
01:36:50,277 --> 01:36:54,013
But, it's unfair of you...
to blame me for all of it.

1030
01:36:54,014 --> 01:36:57,017
If that is your attitude...
why did you want to meet me?

1031
01:36:57,018 --> 01:36:59,653
Why did you call me here?

1032
01:36:59,654 --> 01:37:03,324
Excuse me, but it was you who
called me on the phone.

1033
01:37:03,325 --> 01:37:05,692
Otherwise, why would I have come?

1034
01:37:05,693 --> 01:37:06,960
The phone call was made by you.

1035
01:37:06,961 --> 01:37:10,320
I didn't even... do you think I had lost
it that I should have called you?

1036
01:37:10,364 --> 01:37:11,766
What do you think I am?

1037
01:37:11,767 --> 01:37:17,128
Looks like they are fighting.
Here is your coconut water.

1038
01:37:18,374 --> 01:37:23,108
I'm leaving.

1039
01:37:23,109 --> 01:37:26,609
Did you not call me... at the factory?
- Why should I?

1040
01:37:26,749 --> 01:37:30,951
You called me at the Bank.

1041
01:37:30,952 --> 01:37:38,021
I did speak to you and you did
ask me meet you here.

1042
01:37:39,595 --> 01:37:44,225
Maybe you are...

1043
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:49,327
Oh God!

1044
01:38:00,916 --> 01:38:02,784
So this was your doing.

1045
01:38:02,785 --> 01:38:06,153
What do you think you are?
A matchmaker?

1046
01:38:06,154 --> 01:38:11,252
Do you want to start
a marriage bureau?

1047
01:38:14,630 --> 01:38:19,957
Actually... Your marriage broke up
because of us. So I felt that...

1048
01:38:28,176 --> 01:38:31,809
It's OK. Your intentions were good.

1049
01:38:34,148 --> 01:38:38,646
But, you didn't do well...
especially with Dina.

1050
01:38:56,136 --> 01:38:59,472
It's been 10 days since we
spoke to each other.

1051
01:38:59,473 --> 01:39:02,970
It's not unusual after marriage.

1052
01:39:03,277 --> 01:39:07,344
Look at Raj. Come.
We don't speak for months at end.

1053
01:39:07,782 --> 01:39:11,151
All our exchanges are
through servants.

1054
01:39:11,152 --> 01:39:14,153
I am beginning to feel that
Adi is tired of me.

1055
01:39:14,154 --> 01:39:16,257
Don't be stupid.

1056
01:39:16,258 --> 01:39:19,826
Everyone says that if Adi ever flirts...
with another girl,

1057
01:39:19,827 --> 01:39:22,162
He'll see you in her.

1058
01:39:22,163 --> 01:39:27,591
Is that any less worrisome?

1059
01:39:33,139 --> 01:39:36,242
How is it?

1060
01:39:36,243 --> 01:39:38,746
Looks like someone is very thirsty.
Why...

1061
01:39:38,747 --> 01:39:40,412
The other day when I was giving
you coconut water...

1062
01:39:40,413 --> 01:39:43,683
You were glaring at me.
Am I a matchmaker...?

1063
01:39:43,684 --> 01:39:45,385
I should start a marriage bureau.

1064
01:39:45,386 --> 01:39:47,388
I think after this success...
I should start one.

1065
01:39:47,389 --> 01:39:50,123
And when should we arrange for
the wedding bells to toll?

1066
01:39:50,124 --> 01:39:51,925
Raghu, will you come on
a white horse?

1067
01:39:51,926 --> 01:39:53,392
Or must I get a black train
booked for you?

1068
01:39:53,393 --> 01:39:55,129
The day after tomorrow,
they are coming home.

1069
01:39:55,130 --> 01:40:00,896
Then, you can book
your black trains.

1070
01:40:02,569 --> 01:40:05,505
What happened?

1071
01:40:05,506 --> 01:40:10,510
I wish Dad were still alive.

1072
01:40:10,511 --> 01:40:17,041
Have this coconut water and
stop the water from your eyes.

1073
01:40:43,243 --> 01:40:47,139
I have ordered food at home.
- What do you mean...?

1074
01:40:47,547 --> 01:40:52,085
Oh sorry! Those people didn't
have a place to party...

1075
01:40:52,086 --> 01:40:55,321
So, I called them here.
- I don't want to party.

1076
01:40:55,322 --> 01:41:02,359
Did you ask me? - I didn't check...
but Anju asked and I said yes.

1077
01:41:02,663 --> 01:41:08,625
Is Anju going to decide...
what is going to happen in my house?

1078
01:41:11,304 --> 01:41:17,266
You should ask me...

1079
01:41:20,114 --> 01:41:21,949
So many people and
so little common sense.

1080
01:41:21,950 --> 01:41:27,808
An open door opens like this
and not like this.

1081
01:41:31,827 --> 01:41:33,858
She'll just be here..

1082
01:41:33,859 --> 01:41:36,998
You were very scared of your parents
...how did they agree?

1083
01:41:36,999 --> 01:41:39,633
I had to smuggle her out...
- You are quite brave.

1084
01:41:39,634 --> 01:41:45,805
This is nothing. One day she took
Bhaskar to meet her parents.

1085
01:41:46,072 --> 01:41:47,842
You are quite an intelligent girl.

1086
01:41:47,843 --> 01:41:50,644
How did you ever get stuck
with this Bhaskar?

1087
01:41:50,645 --> 01:41:55,315
The same way I got stuck with her.

1088
01:41:55,316 --> 01:41:58,847
The minute I looked at her,
my mind started to wander.

1089
01:42:00,488 --> 01:42:02,022
You are a very
discouraging friend.

1090
01:42:02,023 --> 01:42:03,590
Get married first.

1091
01:42:03,591 --> 01:42:07,126
Then, you'll have to find out
the price of food grains.

1092
01:42:07,127 --> 01:42:08,496
Yes from Jeevan stores.

1093
01:42:08,497 --> 01:42:12,833
Suhani knows the rates quite well.
Remember...?

1094
01:42:12,834 --> 01:42:16,936
Men show their true colours
after marriage.

1095
01:42:16,937 --> 01:42:18,437
How's that?

1096
01:42:18,438 --> 01:42:23,143
Before marriage they are piling
on to you everywhere...

1097
01:42:23,277 --> 01:42:26,976
And after marriage they are
embarrassed to even hold you.

1098
01:42:27,848 --> 01:42:28,949
Does that really happen?

1099
01:42:28,950 --> 01:42:31,483
Yes. You are embarrassed
at your doing...

1100
01:42:31,484 --> 01:42:34,586
So the easy way out is a mangalsutra
to wear around the neck.

1101
01:42:34,587 --> 01:42:38,692
Before marriage every man
is special.

1102
01:42:38,693 --> 01:42:42,162
After marriage... he becomes
just another husband.

1103
01:42:42,163 --> 01:42:48,863
For me, Adi can never be ordinary.

1104
01:42:50,904 --> 01:42:54,641
I should have married you.
- What had to happen has happened.

1105
01:43:03,718 --> 01:43:08,153
You are tired of me now.
- What?

1106
01:43:08,154 --> 01:43:11,025
What were you saying?

1107
01:43:11,026 --> 01:43:15,454
Come on Suhani.
You know I was joking.

1108
01:43:15,696 --> 01:43:20,627
It didn't sound like a joke to me.
I've become stale.

1109
01:43:20,935 --> 01:43:23,068
Or have you started to
like someone else?

1110
01:43:23,069 --> 01:43:27,574
Stop this nonsense.

1111
01:43:27,575 --> 01:43:31,612
You never spoke like this
before marriage.

1112
01:43:31,613 --> 01:43:36,344
I am now.

1113
01:43:42,322 --> 01:43:43,757
Nothing has changed even now.

1114
01:43:43,758 --> 01:43:50,220
If you like someone else
you can go with her.

1115
01:43:53,968 --> 01:43:56,035
Now, where should I find
another destiny?

1116
01:43:56,036 --> 01:43:58,104
You were destined for me.

1117
01:43:58,105 --> 01:44:03,896
And now I have to break my head with
you throughout my life.

1118
01:44:05,312 --> 01:44:10,573
That's what you do best.
First, you taunt then you cry.

1119
01:44:16,758 --> 01:44:23,086
Do I trouble you so much?
What is my fault?

1120
01:44:23,330 --> 01:44:28,032
The fault is mine to have left
my parents for you.

1121
01:44:28,734 --> 01:44:33,469
Then, go back to them.

1122
01:45:12,545 --> 01:45:20,652
"A history of atrocities..."

1123
01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:27,755
"And yet, you claim authority"

1124
01:45:37,938 --> 01:45:41,040
"You take us by the hand
and hurt us"

1125
01:45:41,041 --> 01:45:47,802
"Good Heavens, no!"
"Good Heavens, no!"

1126
01:45:50,919 --> 01:45:54,380
"This is not done"

1127
01:45:54,587 --> 01:45:57,924
"A history of atrocities..."

1128
01:45:57,925 --> 01:46:01,387
"And it's blown out
of proportions"

1129
01:46:01,426 --> 01:46:04,632
"The lies in the world
now threaten my life"

1130
01:46:04,633 --> 01:46:06,231
"They're the ones who
inflict atrocities...

1131
01:46:06,232 --> 01:46:07,967
"And they're the ones who complain"

1132
01:46:07,968 --> 01:46:13,934
"Good Heavens, no!"

1133
01:46:17,877 --> 01:46:23,241
"This is not done"

1134
01:46:44,938 --> 01:46:48,106
"Friends..."

1135
01:46:48,107 --> 01:46:53,970
"How am I to spend a lifetime
misled by illusions?"

1136
01:46:54,447 --> 01:47:00,618
"If only I could take away
your illusions"

1137
01:47:01,523 --> 01:47:06,592
"Take away this affliction
of love too"

1138
01:47:06,593 --> 01:47:12,832
"Let that be... or else
how will you manage?"

1139
01:47:13,133 --> 01:47:20,100
"Your attitude, your involvement
shall lead us on"

1140
01:47:20,239 --> 01:47:26,672
"Life's a boat sailing
miles across the sea"

1141
01:47:26,980 --> 01:47:33,083
"We'll have to drown in it,
there's miles of sea ahead"

1142
01:47:33,687 --> 01:47:37,156
"A history of atrocities..."

1143
01:47:37,157 --> 01:47:40,559
"And the pot calling
the kettle black"

1144
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:43,863
"The lies in the world
now threaten my life"

1145
01:47:43,864 --> 01:47:47,166
"They're the ones who inflict atrocities
and they're the ones who complain"

1146
01:47:47,167 --> 01:47:57,010
"Good Heavens, no!"
"Good Heavens, no!"

1147
01:47:57,011 --> 01:48:02,442
"This is not done"

1148
01:48:25,506 --> 01:48:28,141
I've been trying to find you for so long.
I searched everywhere for you.

1149
01:48:28,142 --> 01:48:30,276
Why? Is there something
very important?

1150
01:48:30,277 --> 01:48:35,743
Yes, it's important...
but now I am suddenly shy.

1151
01:48:42,023 --> 01:48:45,159
You... Dina...

1152
01:48:45,160 --> 01:48:48,689
I thought once things got
a little confirmed then...

1153
01:48:48,962 --> 01:48:50,196
You were hiding it from me.

1154
01:48:50,197 --> 01:48:55,229
Of course not. I wanted to meet
and tell you myself.

1155
01:48:55,801 --> 01:48:59,104
That's why, I'd stopped Aditya
from tell you anything.

1156
01:48:59,105 --> 01:49:03,866
Aditya... he knows about
two of you?

1157
01:49:04,078 --> 01:49:10,115
He's the one who brought
us together again. - Yes.

1158
01:49:10,116 --> 01:49:14,183
Dina, I've got to meet Aditya.
- Go and meet Aditya.

1159
01:49:14,255 --> 01:49:20,521
I have to go to Raghu's house.
- To meet your mother-in-law?

1160
01:49:58,464 --> 01:50:02,725
We've got the 90 million project
from Sintel software!

1161
01:50:23,657 --> 01:50:25,659
Hey, what are you watching?
Is this a Ramlila?

1162
01:50:25,660 --> 01:50:27,193
Hey you! Stop there.
Where are you going?

1163
01:50:27,194 --> 01:50:28,492
Sir, I have to go to the station.

1164
01:50:28,493 --> 01:50:29,862
Do I have to write it down for you?

1165
01:50:29,863 --> 01:50:31,329
Can't you hear me?

1166
01:50:31,330 --> 01:50:31,998
Sorry sir, Sorry.

1167
01:50:31,999 --> 01:50:37,504
You can't go from here.
There's been an accident.

1168
01:50:37,505 --> 01:50:38,838
Take a U-turn and go back.
- OK, sir,

1169
01:50:38,839 --> 01:50:43,434
Go on.

1170
01:51:01,863 --> 01:51:03,696
What are you doing?
Waiting for Suhani?

1171
01:51:03,697 --> 01:51:04,763
Like always.

1172
01:51:04,764 --> 01:51:07,767
If you'd married me, you wouldn't
have had to do all this.

1173
01:51:07,768 --> 01:51:09,535
If she doesn't come in
the next ten minutes...

1174
01:51:09,536 --> 01:51:12,138
We'll run away to a temple
and get married.

1175
01:51:12,139 --> 01:51:17,030
Let's go.

1176
01:51:18,243 --> 01:51:22,215
Is Suhani there?
- She has left already.

1177
01:51:22,216 --> 01:51:26,050
Did she say where she was going?

1178
01:51:26,051 --> 01:51:31,479
Are you sure she is not somewhere
in the hospital?

1179
01:51:42,301 --> 01:51:48,594
YASHWANT RAO I.A.S. RESIDENCE

1180
01:51:56,818 --> 01:51:59,085
What happened?

1181
01:51:59,086 --> 01:52:03,257
Who was driving? You?

1182
01:52:03,258 --> 01:52:05,092
What was the need to drive?

1183
01:52:05,093 --> 01:52:06,592
You don't even have a license.

1184
01:52:06,593 --> 01:52:10,351
Are you OK?
Did anyone else get hurt?

1185
01:52:10,932 --> 01:52:14,633
Did anyone?.

1186
01:52:14,634 --> 01:52:19,437
Tell me. Who was it?
- A girl.

1187
01:52:19,438 --> 01:52:22,108
How badly did she get hurt?
...Tell me...

1188
01:52:22,109 --> 01:52:26,044
Is she alive?

1189
01:52:26,045 --> 01:52:29,543
I don't know.
I got scared and ran away.

1190
01:52:31,785 --> 01:52:35,485
Good. It's all right. Did anyone
take her to the hospital?

1191
01:52:36,791 --> 01:52:39,960
Where did the accident happen?

1192
01:52:39,961 --> 01:52:44,296
Kennedy Bridge.

1193
01:52:44,297 --> 01:52:46,632
You relax. I'll go and
see what's happening.

1194
01:52:46,633 --> 01:52:52,799
Don't go.
- You go on inside.

1195
01:53:01,982 --> 01:53:05,918
Has an accident case from Kennedy
Bridge been reported today?

1196
01:53:05,919 --> 01:53:07,353
Yes, a girl has been admitted.

1197
01:53:07,354 --> 01:53:11,356
Is she your relative?
- What? Yes!

1198
01:53:11,357 --> 01:53:16,829
Inform Dr. Murthy and prepare
the O.T. You come with me.

1199
01:53:16,830 --> 01:53:21,927
Hurry up.

1200
01:53:24,837 --> 01:53:30,764
Doctor Khan, come to the
operation theatre. Quick.

1201
01:53:32,446 --> 01:53:36,770
Is she the one?

1202
01:53:39,252 --> 01:53:40,419
She is critical.

1203
01:53:40,420 --> 01:53:41,854
She has been hurt on her head.

1204
01:53:41,855 --> 01:53:44,856
Doctors can't operate on her until
someone takes her responsibility.

1205
01:53:44,857 --> 01:53:46,559
Give me the name.
- Yashwant Rao.

1206
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:49,862
No, what's her name?
- Savitri.

1207
01:53:49,863 --> 01:53:53,132
Savitri. Savitri What?
- Savitri Rao.

1208
01:53:53,133 --> 01:53:55,201
How are you related to her?

1209
01:53:55,202 --> 01:53:56,035
Husband.

1210
01:53:56,036 --> 01:54:02,067
Oh Good. Come with me.
Some papers have to be signed.

1211
01:54:05,779 --> 01:54:06,544
Where are you coming from?

1212
01:54:06,545 --> 01:54:07,546
From the North.

1213
01:54:07,547 --> 01:54:09,481
Meaning? Are you coming from Kashmir?

1214
01:54:09,482 --> 01:54:12,885
No sir. North Bombay Society, Juhu.

1215
01:54:12,886 --> 01:54:14,820
And you...
- He is also... - Shut up!

1216
01:54:14,821 --> 01:54:17,590
What's your name?
- Aditya.

1217
01:54:17,591 --> 01:54:20,626
Where are you going?

1218
01:54:20,627 --> 01:54:24,192
My wife left home in the morning
and hasn't returned.

1219
01:54:24,499 --> 01:54:26,967
Have you lodged an FIR?
- Yes.

1220
01:54:26,968 --> 01:54:29,068
Have you checked the hospitals?
- What?

1221
01:54:29,069 --> 01:54:30,737
A girl met with an accident a little
distance from here.

1222
01:54:30,738 --> 01:54:35,503
Hospital...

1223
01:54:39,578 --> 01:54:42,782
Yes... Yes... I am speaking
from the hospital.

1224
01:54:42,783 --> 01:54:46,520
Because of the commotion I could
not report it earlier...

1225
01:54:46,586 --> 01:54:50,088
No, there is no need
to cover it up.

1226
01:54:50,089 --> 01:54:55,692
Let the law take its course.
I wanted... What...?

1227
01:54:56,596 --> 01:55:01,857
No, her relatives have not
been found yet...

1228
01:55:04,471 --> 01:55:06,940
Has an accident case of
a girl been reported?

1229
01:55:06,941 --> 01:55:08,474
When? - This evening...e

1230
01:55:08,475 --> 01:55:11,108
What's the name?
- Dr. Suhani. Suhani Sehgal.

1231
01:55:11,109 --> 01:55:13,278
There is no one by this name.

1232
01:55:13,279 --> 01:55:15,613
In an emergency case, they obviously
won't know the name.

1233
01:55:15,614 --> 01:55:18,451
Please check for a 22-23
year-old married woman.

1234
01:55:18,452 --> 01:55:19,219
Just a minute.

1235
01:55:19,220 --> 01:55:23,752
Mrs. Savitri Rao. Her husband is on
the phone over there.

1236
01:55:23,955 --> 01:55:27,026
His wife is in the trauma centre.

1237
01:55:27,027 --> 01:55:33,058
Is there any other?
- No.

1238
01:55:38,038 --> 01:55:41,641
Relax, Adi. I think we are
being too pessimistic.

1239
01:55:41,642 --> 01:55:43,142
Never mind. Let's go home.

1240
01:55:43,143 --> 01:55:44,642
Maybe she has reached home.

1241
01:55:44,643 --> 01:55:46,979
Inform me as soon as you
get some information.

1242
01:55:46,980 --> 01:55:48,647
Yes, I am at the Wadia hospital.

1243
01:55:48,648 --> 01:55:53,244
I'll talk to you later.

1244
01:56:04,398 --> 01:56:07,755
We cannot remove the clot
without a surgery.

1245
01:56:23,350 --> 01:56:26,853
Our area starts from this side
of the bridge...

1246
01:56:26,854 --> 01:56:30,022
If the blast is on that side...

1247
01:56:30,023 --> 01:56:32,092
Can't you see that I am
talking to someone?

1248
01:56:32,093 --> 01:56:33,192
I see that sir.

1249
01:56:33,193 --> 01:56:34,193
For the last half an hour...

1250
01:56:34,194 --> 01:56:36,897
You have been going from one side to
the other side of the bridge.

1251
01:56:36,898 --> 01:56:41,233
I'll call you back.

1252
01:56:41,234 --> 01:56:42,867
What is your problem?

1253
01:56:42,868 --> 01:56:45,204
Sir, it's been so long since
I lodged an FIR.

1254
01:56:45,205 --> 01:56:48,040
My wife is missing.
Have you found anything?

1255
01:56:48,041 --> 01:56:49,708
We'll tell you when we find out.
Now, go away.

1256
01:56:49,709 --> 01:56:51,544
Will the news travel to you?

1257
01:56:51,545 --> 01:56:53,211
Sir, at least make an attempt...

1258
01:56:53,212 --> 01:56:54,213
Make some enquiries.

1259
01:56:54,214 --> 01:56:55,882
You should know who she has
run away with.

1260
01:56:55,883 --> 01:56:59,050
Why are you wasting my time...?

1261
01:56:59,051 --> 01:57:00,885
How dare you assault a cop
inside a police station...?

1262
01:57:00,886 --> 01:57:02,053
How dare you talk about
my wife...?

1263
01:57:02,054 --> 01:57:02,720
Leave me. Let me go...

1264
01:57:02,721 --> 01:57:03,722
What if I don't leave it.
What can you do?

1265
01:57:03,723 --> 01:57:09,491
Even you'll be reported missing.

1266
01:57:10,264 --> 01:57:12,231
Sir, he's the son of
Barrister Seghal.

1267
01:57:12,232 --> 01:57:18,159
His wife has been missing
for so many hours...

1268
01:57:24,243 --> 01:57:28,248
I told you I'd take care of everything.
Why did you come here?

1269
01:57:28,249 --> 01:57:32,684
You are taking care... of me.

1270
01:57:32,685 --> 01:57:35,755
The surgery is over... but your wife
is still unconscious.

1271
01:57:35,756 --> 01:57:38,290
You'll have to wait.

1272
01:57:38,291 --> 01:57:42,027
I hope there is nothing to fear?
- She's still in coma...

1273
01:58:00,779 --> 01:58:02,647
We have located the FIR.

1274
01:58:02,648 --> 01:58:04,784
The girl's husband has lodged it.

1275
01:58:04,785 --> 01:58:07,117
His name is Aditya Sehgal.

1276
01:58:07,118 --> 01:58:08,121
It won't be difficult to trace.

1277
01:58:08,122 --> 01:58:10,623
You don't have to worry now.

1278
01:58:10,624 --> 01:58:14,126
Even he is tracing her frantically.

1279
01:58:14,127 --> 01:58:16,961
You both go home.
I'm here, isn't it?

1280
01:58:16,962 --> 01:58:23,567
No. We'll wait here. Once we have
handed this girl over...

1281
01:58:24,471 --> 01:58:28,540
Then, it's up to him.

1282
01:58:28,541 --> 01:58:32,311
What can the poor boy do
in this crisis?

1283
01:58:32,312 --> 01:58:36,070
Don't worry. Savitri didn't do
it deliberately.

1284
01:58:36,216 --> 01:58:38,751
It's an accident.

1285
01:58:38,752 --> 01:58:42,250
Whatever it is.
We'll wait here.

1286
01:58:44,325 --> 01:58:50,922
OK... I'll go and locate him then.

1287
01:58:56,435 --> 01:58:59,505
Is there a Aditya Sehgal among you?
- Yes. I am.

1288
01:58:59,506 --> 01:59:03,508
Aditya. Did you lodge an FIR
about your missing wife?

1289
01:59:03,509 --> 01:59:06,178
Yes... have you found anything?
- What was she wearing?

1290
01:59:06,179 --> 01:59:08,847
A light brown sari.
- Any watch or handbag?

1291
01:59:08,848 --> 01:59:11,684
Yes. A watch, a handbag, stethoscope.
I had lodged everything...

1292
01:59:11,685 --> 01:59:13,353
Come with me. - Where?

1293
01:59:13,354 --> 01:59:19,780
To your wife. Come on, sit inside.

1294
01:59:31,872 --> 01:59:36,637
Over there. She is in the ICU.

1295
01:59:50,291 --> 01:59:55,323
Suhani. Open your eyes.

1296
01:59:57,497 --> 02:00:00,299
You would talk throughout the day.

1297
02:00:00,300 --> 02:00:02,969
Now, why don't you speak?

1298
02:00:02,970 --> 02:00:07,306
Say something. Open your eyes.

1299
02:00:07,307 --> 02:00:11,338
Are you angry with me...
Please don't be...

1300
02:00:12,911 --> 02:00:17,842
Open your eyes.
Say something please...

1301
02:00:37,770 --> 02:00:42,538
Let us check...

1302
02:01:11,639 --> 02:01:14,641
That's the man whose car hit Suhani.

1303
02:01:14,642 --> 02:01:19,907
He's signed for the surgery as well.

1304
02:01:39,166 --> 02:01:45,594
How is she...?

1305
02:01:47,874 --> 02:01:52,770
You should pray... for yourself.

1306
02:01:55,682 --> 02:02:00,282
If anything happens to her...
I won't let you live in peace.

1307
02:02:15,868 --> 02:02:20,793
How did you hit her?

1308
02:02:22,241 --> 02:02:27,976
And why didn't you tell the police?

1309
02:02:30,917 --> 02:02:35,979
You were drinking and driving,
weren't you?

1310
02:02:44,932 --> 02:02:49,823
I won't let you get away.

1311
02:02:55,741 --> 02:03:01,009
It's not his fault.

1312
02:03:02,080 --> 02:03:06,085
Then, whose fault is it?

1313
02:03:06,086 --> 02:03:08,921
The one who is battling
for her life?

1314
02:03:08,922 --> 02:03:17,527
No harm will befall her. Before it does,
I will kill myself.

1315
02:03:26,605 --> 02:03:30,534
I hit her. It was my car.

1316
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:32,443
Why should you be punished for that?

1317
02:03:32,444 --> 02:03:36,375
No harm will befall her.
There is a God above.

1318
02:03:37,317 --> 02:03:43,550
What we could do, we have done.

1319
02:03:57,136 --> 02:03:59,972
You can give us whatever punishment
you want to.

1320
02:03:59,973 --> 02:04:06,577
But, right now even we are praying
for your wife's recovery.

1321
02:05:41,575 --> 02:05:46,646
I know you are listening
to everything.

1322
02:05:46,647 --> 02:05:49,914
You are just pretending...

1323
02:05:49,915 --> 02:05:54,175
To trouble me... to fight with me.

1324
02:05:58,125 --> 02:06:02,862
Come now, get up. Right now.

1325
02:06:06,598 --> 02:06:11,669
Aren't you going to mark the
date on the calendar?

1326
02:06:11,670 --> 02:06:14,673
You didn't come home one day,

1327
02:06:14,674 --> 02:06:19,878
And everything is devastated...

1328
02:06:19,879 --> 02:06:23,206
How much I searched for you today...

1329
02:06:24,116 --> 02:06:29,385
I didn't search for you like this
even before marriage.

1330
02:06:32,290 --> 02:06:40,224
The truth is that today I have
understood our relationship.

1331
02:06:42,301 --> 02:06:47,061
For the first time I have
understood you. Found you.

1332
02:06:50,477 --> 02:06:54,713
Now, I can't lose you.

1333
02:06:54,714 --> 02:07:00,577
Till now I was only trying
to find myself.

1334
02:07:21,008 --> 02:07:25,604
Please come back...

1335
02:08:28,241 --> 02:08:30,742
Were you scared?

1336
02:08:30,743 --> 02:08:35,340
I just died.

1337
02:08:35,915 --> 02:08:38,416
What did you think?

1338
02:08:38,417 --> 02:08:43,347
That I'd let you flirt with
other women so easily?

1339
02:08:55,602 --> 02:09:00,867
What can you do for me?

1340
02:09:02,276 --> 02:09:06,445
Can you jump off a moving train?

1341
02:09:06,446 --> 02:09:14,041
