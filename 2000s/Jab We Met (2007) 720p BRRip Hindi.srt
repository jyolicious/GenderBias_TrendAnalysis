1
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,665
Adi.. - Although going to the
court is beneficial to her..

2
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:28,999
ln just 4 hearings the matter
will become clear..

3
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:31,415
And she will know what she
genuinely deserves..

4
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:32,999
.. and what she should expect
from this company!

5
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:35,665
Look, l don't think we should
jump to any conclusions!

6
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:08,207
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, sir.

7
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,207
Hello, Mr. Kashyap.
Nice meeting you.

8
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,665
Passengers, attention please, this
is the train, boarding to..

9
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:46,874
Delhi from Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus
... from platform no. 5 at 8:05.

10
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,957
Mister, hold this luggage!
- Let me get in!

11
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,332
Give it! Give it!
Give it to that gentlemen!

12
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:03,999
Madam, you quickly get in!

13
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,874
You don't worry about me! Just load the
luggage inside! Quickly! Here!

14
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:09,790
Ma'am, l told you in the beginning itself
you have luggage enough for two coolie's!

15
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,665
Here.. Hold the frame carefully!
lts Babaji's frame!

16
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:12,665
ls there more luggage?

17
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,999
Don't worry! No matter how much
more luggage there is. Let it come.

18
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,207
Here!
- Here! Here! Hold this! This is really risky!

19
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:21,790
Ma'am, you please look ahead!
- Yes, l am! You just quickly load the luggage!

20
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:30,207
Come on! Come on! - Give me
your hand! Give me your hand!

21
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,415
Oh God!

22
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:36,957
This was the limit,
l crossed the line today!

23
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:39,207
Do you know what?

24
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,207
Till date l have not missed
a single train!

25
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:47,207
Thank you, Babaji! You saved
me from breaking my record!

26
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,207
one minute.

27
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:51,665
l am inside now.
- Yes

28
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:55,415
You can leave my hand now..
l am not that beautiful!

29
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,207
l prefer travelling in
a Non-AC compartment.

30
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:02,082
But my family.. they
say 'you are a girl!'

31
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,082
As if l don't know that l am a girl!

32
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,665
Mister, is this A1 ?
- Yes!

33
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:07,374
Thank you!

34
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,874
Now what is the connection
between AC and a girl?

35
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:12,082
l don't understand that!

36
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,207
l am not travelling alone
for the first time!

37
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,999
That too in this train! This
is like my second home!

38
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,332
Please show me your ticket.

39
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,415
Hello! l am talking to you!

40
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:40,082
Hey! This is my seat. 23!

41
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:48,999
Strange. Hey, mister!
This seat is mine! 23!

42
00:07:54,666 --> 00:08:00,207
Nobody likes to take the passage seat
But l always insist on the passage seat.

43
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:02,999
The reservation uncle gets
very alarmed and worried.

44
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:07,415
But my logic is that.. my journey
doesn't end with this train!

45
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,332
l am going to Bhatinda.

46
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,665
My house is there.
My family is there.

47
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:13,665
Everybody has a family.
l have one too.

48
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,207
Everybody says that Mumbai
is a crowded city.

49
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:18,665
What do you mean by crowded?
People like us form the crowd!

50
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,999
They are a part of the crowd!
Still they crib!

51
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,207
l am leaving Mumbai! Forever!
Do you know when l came here?

52
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,207
When Mumbai was Bombay!
Hostel! Hostel! Hostel!

53
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,332
St. Teresa's boarding school
hostel in Shimla!

54
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,415
Missionary hostel for college
girls in Bombay Central!

55
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:35,415
l swear! Henceforth l will never
live in a hostel again!

56
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,582
l hope the road digging
stops before the monsoon.

57
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:39,874
Otherwise do you know
what will happen?

58
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,665
Anyway! What happened?

59
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,207
What are you doing?!

60
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:23,040
.. last time a kid fell and died..
lt's really dangerous!

61
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:29,207
Are you dumb? You can't talk?

62
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:35,207
Or are you shy?
Or are you just insolent?

63
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:42,040
Something is surely the matter! l have
asked three times... but still no answer!

64
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,665
Ticket please!

65
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,207
lt's on the berth! l will
just give it to you!

66
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,332
Excuse me, mister! Ticket please!

67
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:52,665
Hello, mister! First
come inside! Come on!

68
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:57,957
Show me your ticket!

69
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,874
He wants to see your ticket. Ticket!

70
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,957
Where is your ticket?
- l don't have a ticket.

71
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,665
Actually you see what
happened is that..

72
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,040
his plan was made at
the very last minute.

73
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,207
So there was no time
to buy a ticket.

74
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:18,207
By the way the train is quite empty
- So you can give him a ticket now.

75
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:19,957
There is no problem, right?

76
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,999
Mister! Are you convinced
or shall l say more?

77
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,790
Ticket for where?

78
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:31,207
Hello!

79
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,332
Where is this train going?
- What?

80
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,415
Last stop. Delhi. Give
him a ticket to Delhi.

81
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:48,415
Look. l might as well tell you.
A tragedy has occurred with him.

82
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:55,290
He is going through bad times.
So that's why he.. Delhi!

83
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:06,790
Oh Mister! What's the matter?
Are you doing drugs?

84
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:11,790
Look, if there is any problem,
then you can tell me.

85
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,790
l don't mind! Tell me!

86
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:19,040
All my friends tell
me their problems! And l solve it!

87
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:21,207
Do you know? l am that
kind of a girl!

88
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,790
Like an agony aunt whose articles
you find in the magazines?

89
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,999
l'm just like that!
Tell me! What's the matter?

90
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,207
Tell me what is your problem?

91
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:30,415
Tell me! Don't feel shy! What
is your problem? Tell me!

92
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,207
You are my problem!
You are talking non-stop!

93
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:36,040
Don't you understand that l am not
interested in talking to you?

94
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,207
l don't want to talk to you!

95
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:40,415
l don't want to know whether you
are going to Bhatinda or Benaras!

96
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,999
Whether you lived in some
hostel or some brothel!

97
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,415
l just don't care! All right!

98
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:46,665
So just please! Please! Leave
me alone! All right!

99
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,874
That thing about brothel
was not right!

100
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,999
Yeah! l.. look.. l..

101
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,999
l know! You are clearly very
upset about something!

102
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,207
That's why you got
upset with me too!

103
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:12,957
And you started talking nonsense!
But it's okay! l don't feel bad!

104
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,790
Actually nowadays l don't
feel bad about anything!

105
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,874
Do you know why?

106
00:12:17,166 --> 00:12:19,415
Because l am going to
get married! Very soon!

107
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:21,499
Listen! l am eloping!

108
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,082
The guy is not Sikh so
my family won't agree!

109
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,999
But what can anybody do
after the marriage?

110
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,999
We will go and fall at their feet!
They will have to forgive us!

111
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,207
l like mountains a lot! Really!

112
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:34,415
Since childhood l had this
craze for marriage! By God!

113
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,332
What is the difference between
hill and mountain?

114
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:37,957
l could never understand.

115
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:42,207
l was just waiting for my college to get over
And his travel agency to open up!

116
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,999
But you don't find good
shoes there. That's why..

117
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,124
Hang on!

118
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,665
Hey! The train is leaving!

119
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:26,665
Listen! Hero!
- What's his name?

120
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,415
Hey, mister!
- His name is mister!

00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,415
Look here!

122
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,874
Oh God!

Where are you going, ma'am?

00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,665
The train is leaving!
- Ma'am!

126
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:43,999
Ma'am!... Ma'am!

127
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,874
Hey, black pant!
- Ma'am!

128
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:51,207
Hey, Mumbai guy! Listen!
The train is leaving!

129
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:52,415
Hello!

130
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,665
Are you mad? The train
is leaving! Come on!

131
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:04,040
What? Go to hell!

132
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:15,665
Ma'am, what have you done?
Where are you running away?

133
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,790
Who will pay the compensation?
- Leave me! The train is leaving!

134
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:25,040
Stop! Somebody pull the chain! Stop!

135
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:33,999
Such a fat woman!

136
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,665
Even a blind man could
see such a big basket!

137
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:37,874
And this crazy girl!

138
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:41,415
Now l don't know in which corners
my tomatoes are lying!

139
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:46,207
l will pick it up from here! You
pick it from there! - Okay!

140
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:52,040
You stupid weirdo!
Which world do you live in huh?

141
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,040
l have missed my train
because of you.

142
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,415
My entire luggage has gone!
l have lost everything!

143
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,499
And now l am stuck in these
clothes and slippers..

144
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,415
on this God forsaken
platform called Barnagar?

145
00:15:01,666 --> 00:15:03,207
What will l do now?

146
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:05,874
Did l tell you to get
down from the train?

147
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,874
Can't you mind your own business?

148
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:11,999
Oh! So lt's my mistake! Shameless!

149
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:15,415

should be thanking me!

150
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,499
And instead you are
showing me attitude!

151
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,415
Okay! Thank you! Thank
you for helping me!

152
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:25,415
Now will you please leave me alone?
- Leave you alone?

00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,665
So now you will take me to Bhatinda!

Hey! He is running away!

Hey!

Yes! Come on! Come on! Come on!

Yes! God heard your prayers!
Now come on, move!

00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:41,999
What are you doing?

169

How will we catch the
train like this?

170
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,874
You can't catch the train anyway.

171
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:52,124
Ratlam is the next station. 1 00
kms away.

172
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,874
What do you know what you are?

173
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:02,874
He is mad! He is totally mad!

174
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:05,999
Stop the car!

175
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,665
Stop the car!

176
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,082
What happened?

177
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,999
O God! Couldn't you
hold it for sometime!

178
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,207
Get in! Come on!

179
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:24,124
Hey! What? What are you doing?
What are you doing?

180
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,957
Stop! Stop! Stop!

181
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,665
Don't disturb! There
will be an accident!

182
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,207
Mark Three.. this a Mark
Three Ambassador.

183
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,999
Mister! Please stop! Stop!

184
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:42,207
Everything is shaking! The car is
shaking! Everything is shaking!

185
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,999
You don't be tense! Listen to me!

186
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:48,999
This man is no ordinary man!
Look at his style. He has lots of money!

187
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:53,999
l bought this car by selling my land.
No good can be done by this!

188
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,665
Look, we all are in this situation
because of him..

189
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,665
lf anything breaks.. he
will pay for the damage!

190
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,999
You don't worry! l will
ensure that he pays!

191
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,207
Stop the car! Stop the car!

192
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:06,415
lf anything happens to this car,
then everything will be ruined!

193
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,124
Nothing will happen!

194
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,499
Hey! My fare!

195
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,665
Where are you running away? My fare!

196
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:26,874
Give me my fare!
Hey! Where are you running away?

197
00:18:27,041 --> 00:18:29,040
Hey! They are running away
without paying my fare!

198
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:32,999
'Passengers pay attention. '

199
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:38,415
The train on Platform no. 1
is 21 37 Punjab Mail to Delhi.

200
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,207
The train will stop at
Ratlam for 1 0 minutes

201
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,207
Get in!

00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:46,207
Look, don't try to help me anymore!

My fare! Give me my fare!
- Stop!

204
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:49,665
You are running away!
- Hang on!

205
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,082
Ma'am, you were saying..

206

Money. l need to borrow some money!

l will return it in the train!
- Do you have more? lts full fare right?

208
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:04,207
Look, l am paying you alright.
You quietly stand here! Got it?

209
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,665
Water! l am breathless! By God!

210
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,957
Cold drinks have their own place but finally
only water can quench your thirst!

211
00:19:14,666 --> 00:19:16,999
lt's said.. best things
in the world are free!

212
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,874
But now even water is no
longer free! How much?

213
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,207
14 rupees!- Why? Railway prices are cheaper!

214
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,665
Ma'am, this is the rate!
- ls that so?

215
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,874
Shall l ask the consumer
court what's the rate!

216
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:29,415
You are trying to fool me!

217
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:31,665
For 2 rupees you are
arguing so much!

218
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,332
lf 2 rupees are nothing, then
why are you stealing?

219
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,124
Stealing?
- Then what?

220
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:39,082
And you are saying
that l am arguing! Return my money!

221
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:41,874
Here!

222
00:20:06,666 --> 00:20:08,207
Stop!

223
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:19,415
Stop! Somebody pull the chain! Stop! Stop! Stop!

224
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:07,499
The next station is Kota. l
will call the station master.

225
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,207
He will keep your luggage there.

226
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:17,207
Nothing else can be done.

227
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:22,665
But how will l reach there? Shit.

228
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:26,040
Who told you to get
down from the train?

229
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,790
You should have been alert!
Now what will you do?

230
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:39,665
Zest of youth! You don't understand!
You don't understand!

231
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:44,790
Look.. life is like
a railway track..

232
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:49,207
1 inch bend. And a distance
of many miles..

233
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:54,332
Your small mistake
can ruin your life!

234
00:21:57,208 --> 00:22:03,415
Yes! l too have missed many trains..
But at that time l was a man!

235
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:08,874
l mean l am still a man..
but.. you are a girl.

236
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,665
A girl travelling alone is
like an open treasure box!

237
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,999
Yes! Do you know? Do you know?

238
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,665
What all things could
happen with you?

239
00:22:19,208 --> 00:22:21,124
l will tell you! Look..

240
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:23,874
Excuse me! l want to ask you..

241
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,415
What you are saying.. do
you charge money for it?

242
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:29,415
Or is this free education?
- No, this is for free.

243
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:32,040
Good! Because l don't
have any small change!

244
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:35,665
Look, old man! Stop this nonsense.
And do your work!

245
00:22:36,125 --> 00:22:39,665
Call Kota! The rest is my problem
l will handle it! You.. Quickly call!

246
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:45,999
Come on! Come on!

247
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,790
A 23 Seat Number passenger's
luggage..

248
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,415
Your water!

249
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:09,582
l am not a thief! lt's really bad!

250
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:11,957
What happened? What happened?

251
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:13,415
This poor girl missed her train!

252
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:17,999
There is no train till morning!
- O God!

253
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:19,957
ls she alone?
- Yes!

254
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:25,207
Now what will she do?
- Exactly! Do you know?

255
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:28,665
A girl travelling alone is
like an open treasure box!

256
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:31,999
Listen, don't try to act smart!
Got it? Get lost!

257
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:37,207
Am l a bomb that l will explode?
Try to understand, ma'am!

258
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,665
Before somebody tries to
take undue advantage..

259
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:42,207
l thought.. l will help you.

260
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:46,040
Don't let her stay here
at night alone..

261
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:49,957
You will have to take some trouble.
But.. take her somewhere.

262
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,957
Yes. There is no other option.

263
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,999
Don't try to act too smart!
Got it? Get lost!

264
00:23:57,208 --> 00:23:59,665
This is the limit! Nobody
appreciates decency!

265
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:01,999
Tell me! l am taking you to
the right place and you..

266
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:02,957
Shut up!

267
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:05,999
l will give you a slap
if you talk too much!

268
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:13,415
Let her slap you. At least
she will touch you.

269
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:18,790
Fine! lf this is what makes
you happy, then slap me.

270
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:24,999
Fulfil your wish. Slap me. Slap me!

271
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,874
Where are you going? Today l won't
leave before you slap me!

272
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:34,582
Listen brother!

273
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:39,415
Hey!

274
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:42,415
Oh no!

275
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,999
Hey! Come!

276
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,207
Come on! Come on! Just one man.. Full night!

00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:28,874

278
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,665

279
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:40,999
Listen! lf you want money,
then l will give it to you!

280
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:46,999
Why are you acting pricey?
Come on! Come! Listen!

281
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,207
You drunkard! You come here
everyday! Get lost! Come!

282
00:25:53,333 --> 00:25:56,957
Why are you making me run around
at night? Listen to me!

283
00:25:57,583 --> 00:25:58,999
l will pay you!

284
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,207
She is acting so smugly! Listen!

285
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,415
Thank you, Babaji! Thank you!

286
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:12,665
O God! God knows what would

287
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:15,290
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you!

288
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,999
You missed the train again?

289
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,665
And who is this joker on the bike?

290
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:29,874
Hi! l am Geet!

291
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:37,999
Aditya!
- Aditya! Pleased to meet you..

292
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:40,999
lnfact.. l have never felt as

00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:42,790
.. as l feel after meeting you today!

294
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:46,332
Because you are the one who has
started all these problems!

295
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:49,665
Remember.. l told you not
to have any doubt..

296
00:26:50,666 --> 00:26:55,415
l will not let you go! You
will escort me home!

297
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,415
l have seen that you have
money in your wallet..

298
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:00,665
We will stay in some
hotel till morning

299
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:02,415
Then we will go to Kota. Collect
the luggage.

300
00:27:02,666 --> 00:27:04,957
And then all the way
to Bhatinda! Come on!

301
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:10,040
Come! You can give me tough
look while walking too!

302
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:11,082
Come on! Come on! Come on!

303
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:21,415
Ratlam! Come on! lt's the limit!

304
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:25,499
What does this mean? l am roaming
in the lanes of Ratlam!

305
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,290
From the train l would watch
these houses, these lanes!

306
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:31,499
Life is so strange! Right?

307
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:33,957
You are having a lot of fun, right?

308
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:38,749
As if we have come for a picnic.
You should be kept in a museum!

309
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,957
People should be charged
for seeing you!

310
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:45,499
What's the matter? And where
should you be kept?

311
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,415
You are in the train but you don't
know where the train is going!

312
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,332
You get down on some
unknown station!

313
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:52,415
Then you drive the car
like a crazy man..

314
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:54,999
.. almost killing me..
you reach here.

315
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:59,874
And here.. you are walking
in the dark lanes!

316
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,874
Alone! ln the lanes of Ratlam!

317
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:06,207
What is your problem? Tell me!

318
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:08,415
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!

319
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:11,499
You don't share your problems
with anybody!

320
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:16,665
Right! Are you Bachchan's
fan? Angry young man!

321
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:23,665
Today you will be very happy!
Agnipath! Agnipath!

322
00:28:23,708 --> 00:28:28,207
Tell me, who's your favorite hero?

323
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:31,790
Tell me, there is no secret in this..

324
00:28:32,666 --> 00:28:36,332
God!...Where have l come? What
am l doing? Why?

325
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:48,207
Come on! Please!

326
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:55,874
Do you accept credit card?

327
00:28:56,416 --> 00:29:00,124
No credit! Only cash!
- Credit card!

328
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:04,665
What's the tariff?
- What?

329
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,207
How much do you charge for
a room for a single day?

330
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:11,999
Do you need the room per hour?

331
00:29:13,666 --> 00:29:15,207
Just answer what l
am asking you! OK?

332
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:16,790
How much for a room for a day?

333
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,415
Why do you need it for the whole day?
We don't have to stay here the whole day!

334
00:29:19,666 --> 00:29:22,957
Listen, let me talk! - Yes. You
are talking a lot of sense.

335
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:24,415
As it is we have less money!

336
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:25,665
We will take the room
on a per hour basis!

337
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:27,415
Geet! You are not understanding
what he is..

338
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:29,999
Be practical! Why do
you feel ashamed?

339
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:31,790
We need it just for a few hours!

340
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,415
We will take the room
on per hour basis!

341
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:38,665
How many hours?

342
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:43,999
2.. 2 hours will be enough?

343
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,124
Fine! To be on the
safe side 3 hours!

344
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:49,082
3 hours are more than enough!

345
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:58,999
3 hours!- Ok.

346
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:13,999
Where did you find her?
- ln the train!

347
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:17,665
ln the train? You met
her in the train?

348
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:21,040
Nice idea!

349
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:31,415
Listen, how is the item?
Hot! Beauty!

350
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:34,499
Thanks! 3 hours!

351
00:30:44,416 --> 00:30:46,040
What were you whispering to him?

352
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:49,332
You are such a cartoon!
Do you know that?

353
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,499
Possible! But l know karate!
- So?

354
00:30:56,416 --> 00:30:59,082
l am just informing you!
l am brown belt!

355
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,665
l see! l see! l see!
You know karate.

356
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:09,207
Meaning if l tried to rape you..
then you will use karate on me!

357
00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:10,040
Right?

358
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,040
Possible! l mean yes! Absolutely!

359
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,582
l just look like this.. But
l have beaten many people!

360
00:31:21,083 --> 00:31:24,207
Don't worry! l won't rape you!

361
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:28,874
You can't do it!
- l don't want to do it!

362
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,332
Even if you wanted to, you couldn't!

363
00:31:30,583 --> 00:31:33,207
Are you trying to provoke
me to rape you?

364
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:34,999
No! l am just trying to clear it

365
00:31:35,416 --> 00:31:36,874
So that you don't get
any wrong signal!

366
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:40,207
l hugged you at the station.
And l said let's go to some hotel.

367
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,665
l don't know what you
must be thinking.

368
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,415
That too a man like you!

369
00:31:44,791 --> 00:31:46,749
A man like me? Meaning?

370
00:31:47,125 --> 00:31:50,874
Girls must be hovering
around you in Mumbai! Those kinds of girls!

371
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:55,290
But let me tell you that l
am not that kind of a girl. Don't even think of it!

372
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:59,207
My thinking is orthodox!
One man woman!

373
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:05,415
And l have a boyfriend! Anshuman!
One and only! Forever and ever!

374
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:09,665
You will be happy to know that
l too am a one woman man. All right?

375
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:12,665
Look at this!

376
00:32:13,041 --> 00:32:17,999
Show! Show! Show! Wow! She
is really beautiful!

377
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:19,415
You are very lucky!

378
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:25,082
No! l am not lucky!
- What?

379
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:32,957
Oh! So this is the problem!
This girl has dumped you!

380
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,874
Life has dumped me!
- What do you mean?

381
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,874
O God! The famous silence and all!

382
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,207
What is this great secret of yours?

383
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,082
l have told you everything!
Why can't you tell me?

384
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:55,874
Anyway! Look! Look at this photo!

385
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,790
This girl has ditched you.
Right? Hold this! Burn it!

386
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:04,832
Come on, Geet! You can't be serious!

387
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:06,415
l am damn serious! Burn
the photograph!

388
00:33:06,666 --> 00:33:07,665
What childishness is this!

389
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:10,332
Listen to me! Do this childish
deed! Burn this!

390
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:15,332
You will feel really good! Burn her! Here!

391
00:33:17,666 --> 00:33:20,999
Burn it! Burn it! No tension! Burn it!

392
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,332
Okay! Now go to the bathroom and flush her
out of your life forever! Go!

393
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:06,040
Do you feel better?
- You know what?

394
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:08,999
Doing this foolish thing..

395
00:34:09,666 --> 00:34:11,999
l am actually feeling nice!
l am actually feeling better!

396
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:13,999
You were right!

397
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:18,082
See? And shall l tell you the truth?

398
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,957
You are not bad looking!
You are handsome.

399
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:23,665
You seem to be rich too!

400
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,040
You will find much better
girls than her!

401
00:34:26,208 --> 00:34:27,665
She was nothing compared to you!

402
00:34:27,875 --> 00:34:29,957
Thank you. That's very kind.

403
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:33,665
l am telling you! Am l not a girl?

404
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:37,207
Any girl will be smitten by you!
You are of that type!

405
00:34:37,416 --> 00:34:40,332
Look, l am getting married
to Anshuman and all that.

406
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:43,207
But if he had not been in my
life then you never know..

407
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:50,207
Maybe l would have been smitten
too! Just imagine!

408
00:34:53,416 --> 00:34:55,999
You like yourself a lot, don't you?

409
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,082
A lot! l am my favourite!

410
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:02,665
What happened?

411
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:05,874
l wish l too could
have been like you.

412
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:07,499
That is very difficult.

413
00:35:07,875 --> 00:35:10,665
But you will find a better
girl.. that's for sure!

414
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,415
Why don't you only find
a good one for me?

415
00:35:13,666 --> 00:35:16,082
Tell me something. Do you like me?

416
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:19,207
What?
- Look! Look at me!

417
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:21,415
What kind of question is this!
Geet, don't be stupid!

418
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:22,874
Tell me!

419
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:28,124
Quickly open the door! Run!
Wear your clothes! And quickly run!

420
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:30,665
Give me the full amount!
- Hello! What happened?

421
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:34,207
There is a raid! There is a raid!

422
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,207
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on! Run!

423
00:35:41,416 --> 00:35:43,207
Hey! What is going on?

424
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,207
We will have to run!
- Why?

425
00:35:45,416 --> 00:35:47,999
Police!
- Police! Come on!

426
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:49,665
Come on!

427
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:54,999
Quickly! Hurry up!- Everybody quickly run! l
will open the back door!

428
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:57,207
Listen!

429
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:12,207
Next time get some suitcase to show to
the police. That you belong to a good family.

430
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,415
But l missed my luggage
in the train!

431
00:36:14,666 --> 00:36:17,665
For the first time l am seeing a train girl. Why
don't you book a compartment in the train?

432
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:21,082
Like those meant only for two people
- l will tell you next time! Come on!

433
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:22,415
Come on! Come on! Come on!

434
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:26,874
What was he saying?
- Run! Run!

435
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:38,957
Please, Babaji! This is the limit!

436
00:36:39,208 --> 00:36:41,665
Please don't give any more
excitement for this night!

437
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,082
Now please make this night boring!

438
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,665
The bus will leave in the
morning at 6 o'clock.

439
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:01,290
Are you feeling sleepy?
- No! What about you?

440
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:14,499
That.. Why were you asking me
whether l like you or not.

441
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:19,665
Yes! Tell me! Do you like me?
- But why?

442
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:24,207
There is no answer for this why!
Do you like me? Nice, sweet, great?

443
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:26,999
Tell me quickly!
- Yes!

444
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:29,415
Yes?
- Yes!

445
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,415
lf you like me, then you
will like my sister too.

446
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:36,999
Roop. My cousin. She
is just like me!

447
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:42,874
Listen to me. l am going
to elope every soon.

448
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:46,415
With Anshuman! You
and Roop too elope!

449
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:49,957
Your problem too is the same.
Grandpa won't agree!

450
00:37:50,416 --> 00:37:52,207
And then all four of us will live
together in the mountains.

451
00:37:52,416 --> 00:37:54,499
We will have great fun!
What do you say?

452
00:37:58,416 --> 00:38:00,999
Why don't we do this?
We both will elope.

453
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,207
We both will get married.
And live in the mountains.

454
00:38:02,416 --> 00:38:03,665
Look, it's a convenient option.

455
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:06,665
lf we don't go to Bhatinda now,
then we are eloping anyway.

456
00:38:08,208 --> 00:38:12,874
Look.. if you marry Roop then
l will be your sister-in-law.

457
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,874
Half wife.

458
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,874
What will l do with just half?
l want you completely.

459
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:20,207
You will get complete Roop.
And me partly.

460
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,874
Okay! Okay! Okay! lt's
a bargain offer!

461
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:27,999
Yes. Half free with one!
Free! Free! Free!

462
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:32,999
That makes sense! But if l marry
you, the offer is still valid.

463
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:36,582
l am talking to you about
an alliance with my sister

464
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:38,415
And you are flirting with me!

465
00:38:39,416 --> 00:38:42,999
Do you always talk nonsense?
Or today is a special occasion?

466
00:38:43,875 --> 00:38:45,999
No! l always talk nonsense! You?

467
00:38:46,208 --> 00:38:49,207
This is my first time! Actually
l have never met a girl like you.

468
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:52,415
Come to Bhatinda! l will
introduce you to one!

469
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:34,665
When we started walking.
The paths too started moving.

470
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:42,999
These paths seem lovelier
than the destination.

471
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:51,207
Come. Let's get lost.
Let's get lost somewhere.

472
00:39:51,416 --> 00:39:59,999
Come.. Let's walk for miles.
Where to go? lt should be unknown.

473
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:07,999
When we started walking.
The paths too started moving.

474
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:16,999
These paths seem lovelier
than the destination.

475
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:41,207
Sitting like this, how will
we discover a new path.

476
00:40:42,416 --> 00:40:46,415
You too walk. And l too will walk.

477
00:40:46,666 --> 00:40:49,874
Only then will these distances
bridge someday.

478
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:58,124
Come.. We both should have
no bond with anybody.

479
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:07,207
Come.. Let's walk for miles.
Where to go? lt should be unknown.

480
00:41:07,416 --> 00:41:14,874
When we started walking.
The paths too started moving.

481
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:24,207
These paths seem lovelier
than the destination.

482
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:48,999
l don't like it without you.
l don't like it without you.

483
00:41:49,208 --> 00:41:56,665
On opening the eyes, slumber says.
What fervour is this?

484
00:41:57,416 --> 00:42:04,999
Here and there. God knows where.
This fervour is taking me.

485
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:13,415
Come. We will find
a way in this world.

486
00:42:13,666 --> 00:42:17,207
Let's walk for miles.

487
00:42:17,416 --> 00:42:22,415
Where to go? lt should be unknown.

488
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:29,999
When we started walking.
The paths too started moving.

489
00:42:30,208 --> 00:42:39,665
These paths seem lovelier
than the destination.

490
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:55,207
You are great..

491
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,415
l have never heard anybody
sing so well!

492
00:42:58,666 --> 00:42:59,999
You should have been a singer!

493
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,040
A person doesn't always
get what he wants.

494
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:11,415
Why? l think that whatever a person
really, actually wants..

495
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:12,874
.. is what he gets.

496
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,415
You know there was a time
when l really wanted..

497
00:43:17,666 --> 00:43:21,082
Actually there was no greater passion
in my life than music!

498
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,957
Your life is over now?
You are talking as though are dead!

499
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:34,290
lt's not over but.. Now music..
can't happen anymore.

500
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:39,040
Why? Why can't you do it?
What is your helplessness? Tell me!

501
00:43:42,041 --> 00:43:45,957
O God! Don't tell me! Fine!

502
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:50,665
But don't become an angry
young man again. Please!- Okay.

503
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:02,124
l will start the conversation
- Of course!

504
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:06,874
The water is so nice right?
- Yes!

505
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,207
Have you ever jumped in
such a lake before?

506
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:15,124
Geet, l think we should be leaving!

507
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:16,999
We should try it! We
will have great fun!

508
00:44:17,208 --> 00:44:18,999
Hang on! Hang on! l wanted
to ask you something.

509
00:44:19,208 --> 00:44:21,332
Have you ever consulted
a psychiatrist?

510
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:23,665
O shut up!
- No! You need one, Geet!

511
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:27,207
Shut up! And let's jump! - Okay!
Just relax! Just listen to me!

512
00:44:27,416 --> 00:44:29,499
Just think! We might not get the
chance to do such a thing again!

513
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,999
l don't want to do such a thing
ever! Have you gone mad?

514
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:35,040
You have tried being childish
right? You had great fun

515
00:44:35,083 --> 00:44:38,040
Now try madness!
- Geet, relax! Listen to me!

516
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,207
lt was so much fun!
- You need a psychiatrist!

517
00:44:59,208 --> 00:45:00,207
Don't look here!

518
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,082
Have you heard Dharamraj
Kashyap's name?

519
00:45:05,666 --> 00:45:09,957
The industrialist? Of course!
He died last year! Why?

520
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:11,415
l am his son!

521
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:27,999
You.. are Aditya.. Kashyap!- Yes!

522
00:45:30,083 --> 00:45:30,999
Now you know me.

523
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:35,874
You are the Kashyap!

524
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:40,665
lt was your mother that ran
away with another man?

525
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:45,415
Shit. Sorry.

526
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:51,499
Yes! lt was my mother.. who
ran away with another man.

527
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:54,957
Actually l heard it in the
news in this language..

528
00:45:55,125 --> 00:45:58,207
So it came out that way. l am
really sorry. Really, really!

529
00:45:58,416 --> 00:46:04,499
No, Geet! l will have to hear it!
Why you are you saying sorry?

530
00:46:06,791 --> 00:46:08,665
lf somebody's mother
can be so cheap..

531
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:10,999
lf she can do such a
derogatory deed then..

532
00:46:11,208 --> 00:46:14,999
Mr. Kashyap! You shouldn't talk
so disrespectfully about her

533
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:19,499
Why? That woman destroyed
my entire family

534
00:46:19,833 --> 00:46:22,874
Because of her l will feel ashamed..
.. in front of everybody all my life!

535
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:24,665
So why shouldn't l talk
disrespectfully?

536
00:46:25,041 --> 00:46:29,874
Because she was in love!
- Love? Are you serious!

537
00:46:30,416 --> 00:46:32,207
Look.. she is your mother.

538
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:35,082
So it's difficult to understand
this about her.

539
00:46:35,666 --> 00:46:39,207
But when somebody is in love..
.. then nothing is right or wrong!

540
00:46:39,666 --> 00:46:40,999
Who told you all this?

541
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,415
ln which stupid novel did
you read all these lines?

542
00:46:43,666 --> 00:46:45,999
Everybody says so! All
is fair in love!

543
00:46:46,208 --> 00:46:48,665
Everybody lies! lt's
all hogwash! Got it?

544
00:46:49,666 --> 00:46:51,957
Yes! Yes!

545
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:59,040
Listen! You are so rich!

546
00:46:59,666 --> 00:47:03,415
Elope with my sister! Everybody's
life will prosper!

547
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,207
You.. are an original piece!
Do you know that?

548
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,957
There is no other girl like you!

549
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,499
She has come!

550
00:47:22,666 --> 00:47:24,874
Coming!

551
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,207
Hi, Amrik!

552
00:47:28,416 --> 00:47:31,415
She has come! She has come!
Geet has come, aunt!

553
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,415
So what's the plan?
- Let's see!

554
00:47:36,416 --> 00:47:41,207
You come inside with me!
- No, no! No, Geet!.. l will leave.

555
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:46,874
Where will you go?
- l will be okay! Don't worry!

556
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,415
No! You come inside with me!
l can't let you go like this! Come on!

557
00:47:53,666 --> 00:47:55,415
Geet, really l.. l got to go!

558
00:47:55,666 --> 00:47:58,415
Look, my family is here! Don't
create a scene in front of them!

559
00:47:58,666 --> 00:48:00,874
You stay here for sometime.
l want to talk to you.

560
00:48:01,041 --> 00:48:02,874
Then you can leave! Come on!
- Geet!

561
00:48:04,041 --> 00:48:05,207
Hi, mother!

562
00:48:08,208 --> 00:48:11,207
The authorities in the hostel
didn't look after my niece well!

563
00:48:11,416 --> 00:48:14,207
She has become so thin!
- How are you?

564
00:48:15,333 --> 00:48:18,207
Come! Come! Come on!

565
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,415
Uncle!- Greetings, grandpa!

566
00:48:26,791 --> 00:48:27,874
Who is this guy?

567
00:48:29,041 --> 00:48:31,874
He is my friend, grandpa.
- What kind of friend?

568
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:35,207
Grandpa, that is not so!
- What?

569
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:39,665
l mean.. he is just a friend.
- Then why did you bring him home?

570
00:48:41,166 --> 00:48:43,999
Grandpa.. he is the one
who has brought me home.

571
00:48:44,208 --> 00:48:47,665
l missed the train at
a station in the night.

572
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:49,207
lf he had not been there..

573
00:48:49,416 --> 00:48:52,999
You know. A girl travelling alone
is like an open treasure box.

574
00:48:53,416 --> 00:48:56,415
l didn't even know him.
We met on the train.

575
00:48:57,041 --> 00:48:59,415
Still he has travelled
so far with me.

576
00:48:59,666 --> 00:49:01,874
To Bhatinda! To escort
me home safely!

577
00:49:02,208 --> 00:49:03,874
No other kind of friendship?

578
00:49:04,666 --> 00:49:07,999
Because in my age.. in a
glimpse l get to know..

579
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:11,332
.. what is going on between
a boy and a girl.

580
00:49:11,791 --> 00:49:14,999
Grandpa, please. You
are embarrassing me.

581
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:16,207
Embarrassing you?

582
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,499
lf you had any shame..

583
00:49:19,041 --> 00:49:20,499
Then would you have come home
wearing such clothes?

584
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,665
lf you can come home wearing
such clothes..

585
00:49:22,875 --> 00:49:24,665
then in Mumbai you must
be roaming around naked.

586
00:49:28,208 --> 00:49:28,999
What's his name?

587
00:49:30,666 --> 00:49:33,665
Aditya!
- Aditya what?

588
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,665
Aditya Kumar!- Yeah!

589
00:49:42,208 --> 00:49:46,415
What work do you do?
- l.. am a musician.

590
00:49:47,666 --> 00:49:49,665
Dear, l am indebted to you!

591
00:49:50,166 --> 00:49:54,415
Now you will have to stay
here for a week. With us..

592
00:49:55,041 --> 00:49:59,415
So that we can thank you properly
- Okay!

593
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:01,665
May God protect you!

594
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,415
People in Mumbai don't
eat much! That is true!

595
00:50:05,666 --> 00:50:08,874
Enough! Enough! Enough! Please!
- Please! My stomach will blow apart! Please!

596
00:50:09,041 --> 00:50:12,207
What nonsense! Have you ever heard
of somebody's stomach blowing up?

597
00:50:12,416 --> 00:50:18,082
Then what? lt's really strong! No...
Geet! Geet! Geet! Please save me!

598
00:50:19,125 --> 00:50:21,665
You people didn't give
him buttermilk?

599
00:50:21,875 --> 00:50:24,415
He has come to Punjab and
nobody gave him buttermilk?

600
00:50:24,666 --> 00:50:26,082
l will get it!
- What are you doing?

601
00:50:26,291 --> 00:50:28,999
l have some work with
you! Come inside!

602
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:32,665
You have saved my sister!
l can do anything for you!

603
00:50:32,875 --> 00:50:35,207
l made a mistake by saving your sister!
Henceforth l won't save anybody's sister!

604
00:50:37,666 --> 00:50:40,207
Son, you go ahead. l will
get a night dress for you.

605
00:50:41,875 --> 00:50:44,665
Okay. O God Amrik! l will die!

606
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:47,415
Nothing will happen! Come on!

607
00:50:47,666 --> 00:50:50,874
You don't understand!
My stomach will tear!

608
00:50:52,208 --> 00:50:53,957
You go and check whether the
guest room is open or not.

609
00:50:57,958 --> 00:50:58,999
What happened?

610
00:50:59,208 --> 00:51:01,415
There is a problem.
- Now what happened?

611
00:51:01,666 --> 00:51:06,665
l had told you that here nobody..
.. knows about Anshuman..

612
00:51:10,041 --> 00:51:10,874
Geet! What are you doing?

613
00:51:11,125 --> 00:51:15,332
Good that you came! Aditya,
she is my sister Roop!

614
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:18,665
Roop, he is Aditya! You
have to elope with him!

615
00:51:19,416 --> 00:51:22,665
Geet! Think for a second
before you start talking.

616
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:25,207
And what were you doing inside?

617
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:29,999
Possessive! Already you
are feeling jealous!

618
00:51:30,666 --> 00:51:32,999
Don't worry! We were not doing that!

619
00:51:33,666 --> 00:51:37,665
He is a one woman man!
He will be faithful to you!

620
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:40,665
The room is open!
- So take him!

621
00:51:41,041 --> 00:51:42,999
Why are you making
him stand here? Go!

622
00:51:47,666 --> 00:51:50,957
Listen. You look there!
lt's a secret!

623
00:51:51,791 --> 00:51:53,499
Tomorrow morning get up early!

624
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,332
There is an old tractor in the
field.. We will meet there!

625
00:51:56,583 --> 00:51:58,874
Why?
- Bye! Goodnight!

626
00:52:06,666 --> 00:52:07,290
Goodnight!

627
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:36,624
Wow! Today you are looking
very stylish!

628
00:52:36,916 --> 00:52:40,582
You haven't seen anything yet.
- Just wait and watch..

629
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,415
That's great! You speak
Punjabi so fluently!- That's my style too!

630
00:52:47,791 --> 00:52:50,415
From where did you learn how
to speak Punjabi so fluently!

631
00:52:50,666 --> 00:52:53,790
My.. my mom was a Punjabi!

632
00:52:54,083 --> 00:52:57,207
Oh Yes! So why don't
you talk in Punjabi?

633
00:52:57,291 --> 00:53:00,499
Just like that!
- You should do it, you know.

634
00:53:01,583 --> 00:53:04,415
You woke me up at 5 in the
morning for this chit-chat?

635
00:53:04,791 --> 00:53:07,957
No! There is a problem!
- What happened?

636
00:53:08,208 --> 00:53:11,665
Manjeet is coming!
- Who is this Manjeet now?

637
00:53:11,875 --> 00:53:15,665
Manjeet Mann! They had shifted
to Patiala a few years ago!

638
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,082
Grandpa and the rest have fixed
my marriage with Manjeet!

639
00:53:19,333 --> 00:53:22,415
And they are coming today to see me!
- Hold on! Hold on!

640
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:23,999
Your opinion won't be taken
into consideration?

641
00:53:24,208 --> 00:53:25,415
They will get you married
just like that?

642
00:53:25,666 --> 00:53:28,999
Actually there is a twist
in the tale. - Go ahead.

643
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:32,207
These Mann's.. they are
our old family friends.

644
00:53:32,666 --> 00:53:34,665
Manjeet and l have been
together since childhood.

645
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,874
Everybody said that we will get them..
married when they will grow up!

646
00:53:39,333 --> 00:53:42,874
l would feel nice to hear
that l will marry Manjeet.

647
00:53:43,125 --> 00:53:46,499
While playing family, l never
let Roop be Manjeet's wife!

648
00:53:47,166 --> 00:53:48,999
When we were 8 years old,
Manjeet and l would..

649
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,957
stand on this tractor and
hold hands and say that...

650
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:55,957
we will build our house
on those fields. Then l grew up

651
00:53:56,375 --> 00:53:58,874
And l considered this Manjeet
episode as a joke!

652
00:53:59,125 --> 00:54:01,999
But yesterday l came to know that my
parents have not grown up.

653
00:54:02,208 --> 00:54:05,874
They are serious! Everybody
is serious. And now l am in trouble!

654
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,415
So now what?
- l am running away!

655
00:54:10,791 --> 00:54:13,999
You always talk of running away!
Don't even think of that!

656
00:54:14,208 --> 00:54:15,999
lt's really a cheap thing to do!

657
00:54:16,208 --> 00:54:18,415
There is so many risks and
other problems involved..

658
00:54:18,875 --> 00:54:19,999
There is no other option!

659
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,332
There are countless options!
- Like?

660
00:54:21,583 --> 00:54:26,207
Like.. tell your parents
about Anshuman!- They won't agree!

661
00:54:26,666 --> 00:54:29,415
ln fact they will trap me here
by emotionally blackmailing me!

662
00:54:29,791 --> 00:54:30,874
Bad option!

663
00:54:31,208 --> 00:54:34,874
Look, if you can't explain to your parents
... then forget Anshuman!

664
00:54:36,166 --> 00:54:36,874
Next option!

665
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:39,999
Don't marry anybody!

We need an opportunity

Okay! Silence! Silence!
Settle down! Sit comfortably!

719
00:58:36,666 --> 00:58:46,207
A capricious, bubbly girl. Her mesmerising
eyes are like daggers.

720
00:58:46,416 --> 00:58:50,415
And her beauty is lethal.

721
00:58:50,666 --> 00:58:54,874
When her beauty created rampage,
the discussion started.

722
00:58:56,416 --> 00:59:03,249
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

A capricious, bubbly girl. Her mesmerising

And her beauty is lethal. Her deadly
beauty is the point of discussion.

00:59:26,416 --> 00:59:33,999
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

726
00:59:54,666 --> 00:59:58,207
Whenever that girl
comes to the window.

727
00:59:58,791 --> 01:00:02,665
Some see her and die.
And some die without seeing her.

728
01:00:02,875 --> 01:00:06,415
When she would pass the lanes,
there would be festivity.

729
01:00:06,666 --> 01:00:14,665
Every lover used to celebrate and dance.
And the feast would begin.

Beat the drum. Beat the drum.
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

My youth is yours in any case.
You need not try to steal my beauty.

732
01:00:56,416 --> 01:01:00,207
You need not try to steal my beauty.

733
01:01:00,416 --> 01:01:08,415
Since childhood she had a beloved
His task was to keep the other lovers at bay.

734
01:01:08,666 --> 01:01:12,665
The one whom he had to make
the queen of his heart.

735
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:20,874
She was crazy for somebody else.
One story ended and another began.

Beat the drum. Beat the drum.
Beat the drum. Beat the drum.

01:02:14,875 --> 01:02:17,207
We mainly deal in fertilizers.
- Okay.

741
01:02:18,041 --> 01:02:19,999
And now we are going to enter
pesticide market too.

742

O God!

746
01:02:37,875 --> 01:02:39,207

747
01:02:39,416 --> 01:02:42,082

01:02:42,333 --> 01:02:45,499
ls he looking here?
- Yes! You stay away!

749
01:02:49,333 --> 01:02:50,207
Did he see?

750
01:02:53,208 --> 01:02:55,207
Manjeet, she is just playing
a drama! Stand straight!

751
01:02:57,416 --> 01:02:59,665
O no! Manjeet!

752
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,415
Look, Manjeet! What you are
thinking.. that's not true!

753
01:03:06,666 --> 01:03:08,999
She is playing a charade!
Ask her! Tell him!

754
01:03:09,791 --> 01:03:12,040
Yes, yes! He is right, Manjeet!

755
01:03:12,416 --> 01:03:15,332
There is nothing between
us! l swear!

756
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:18,999
We are just by-the-way friends.
Tell him, Aditya!

757
01:03:19,666 --> 01:03:21,957
Nothing had happened between
us even in Bombay!

758
01:03:22,125 --> 01:03:24,415
Nothing at all! Tell him!

759
01:03:24,666 --> 01:03:28,665
Papa said he didn't call me!
- He is lying! l will come!

760
01:03:33,041 --> 01:03:33,790
Listen, brother!

761
01:03:34,416 --> 01:03:38,332
You are mistaken! There is nothing
between me and Geet!

762
01:03:38,791 --> 01:03:42,665
We didn't even meet in Bombay!
She was just playing a charade!

763
01:03:43,166 --> 01:03:48,874
l might not be smart like city people!
But l do have eyes! l can see!

764
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,415
She did all this to show you!
- Why?

765
01:03:51,666 --> 01:03:53,415
Because..
- Tell me!

766
01:03:54,041 --> 01:03:58,415
Why would she want to show me this?
- You better ask her that!

767
01:03:58,875 --> 01:04:00,957
As it is you both have known
each other since childhood..

768
01:04:31,416 --> 01:04:32,665
Don't shout!

769
01:04:34,666 --> 01:04:36,207
Are you mad? What
are you doing here?

770
01:04:36,416 --> 01:04:38,665
Congratulations! You
ruined everything!

771
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,874
l had such a nice plan in place!

772
01:04:41,041 --> 01:04:42,999
By now Manjeet would have
returned to Patiala!

773
01:04:43,208 --> 01:04:45,999
Now he says that he will
talk to me alone!

774
01:04:46,208 --> 01:04:48,290
So l am going!
- Where?

775
01:04:49,208 --> 01:04:50,874
What do you mean where?
l am running away!

776
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,999
Geet.. don't ever do that! Okay!

777
01:04:54,875 --> 01:04:59,415
l am doing it! Everything is planned!
l have come say bye to you!

778
01:04:59,875 --> 01:05:02,665
You are leaving now?
As in right now?

779
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:07,415
Yes! You stay here for a few days!
After that you go back to Bombay! Okay!

780
01:05:07,666 --> 01:05:10,040
Hang on! Hang on! You
are running away!

781
01:05:10,083 --> 01:05:11,874
And l should stay here!
- So?

782
01:05:13,208 --> 01:05:15,624
Tomorrow Manjeet will open his
mouth and these people..

783
01:05:15,666 --> 01:05:17,999
.. who already think you and
l are having an affair..

784
01:05:18,208 --> 01:05:20,332
.. they will tie me with
their buffaloes!

785
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:23,207
Great! Then you come with me too!

786
01:05:23,416 --> 01:05:28,207
lf we run away together then their
suspicion will be confirmed!

787
01:05:28,416 --> 01:05:31,874
Big deal! What difference
does that make to you?

788
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,665
Correct! What difference
does that make to me?- Come on!

789
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:52,665
Listen! Did you tell Roop that
we are running away? - Why?

790
01:05:55,208 --> 01:05:57,040
O God! Run!- Geet!

791
01:06:09,458 --> 01:06:12,082
Geet!
What are you doing?

792
01:06:12,333 --> 01:06:15,082
l will return in two days!
l will call you tomorrow!

793
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:18,415
And please! You are under my oath!
Don't tell anybody! Okay?

794
01:06:19,791 --> 01:06:21,665
Papa! Uncle!
- What's the plan?

795
01:06:21,875 --> 01:06:23,874
Geet is running away!
- There are many options! - Options?

796
01:06:24,125 --> 01:06:26,040
We can either go to the railway
station or the bus stand!

797
01:06:26,083 --> 01:06:26,999
But how will we reach there?

798
01:06:27,208 --> 01:06:28,999
Let's see! We might get an auto
rickshaw from the main road!

799
01:06:29,208 --> 01:06:31,415
Unbelievable, man!
- Come on!

800
01:06:31,666 --> 01:06:32,207
This is your plan?

801
01:06:32,416 --> 01:06:33,665
Let's see, we might get an auto
rickshaw from the main road?

802
01:06:33,958 --> 01:06:35,249
Do you have any brains?

803
01:06:35,541 --> 01:06:37,874
Did l know that Roop will see us?
Now why are we standing here?

804
01:06:39,666 --> 01:06:42,499
Why are you looking there? Run!
- Not there! Here! Come on!

805
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:43,999
l am not going back!

806
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:47,665
You have created enough nuisance!
Now do as l say! Come on! Come on!

807
01:06:47,875 --> 01:06:49,874
But why are we going back?
- Just shut up and run!

808
01:06:56,666 --> 01:06:58,999
Where did they go?
- Towards the road!

809
01:06:59,208 --> 01:07:02,207
You let them go? You didn't stop them?
Satya, go and check! Hurry up!

810
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,790
Call the guys! -Hey guys!

811
01:07:06,666 --> 01:07:08,207
There is a staircase for
going to the terrace.

812
01:07:08,416 --> 01:07:11,957
Why the terrace?
- Will you tell me? Come on!

813
01:07:12,791 --> 01:07:15,665
Hey, quickly open the garage!
Take the jeep out!

814
01:07:15,875 --> 01:07:16,665
Found them?

815
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:18,499
Where will they go?

816
01:07:19,041 --> 01:07:20,999
Where did you see them?
- They left from the gate!

817
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,999
What happened?
- l knew it! ln the first glance l recognized him!

818
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:28,415
Raj, get my wallet from the room.

819
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,790
l found out what is going
on between them!

820
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:33,415
But you people are very
intelligent, aren't you?

821
01:07:33,666 --> 01:07:35,207
You people don't heed me!

822
01:07:36,208 --> 01:07:39,874
Where are you? Open the garage!
Come on!

823
01:07:45,916 --> 01:07:46,915
What are we doing here?

824
01:07:48,583 --> 01:07:50,790
Look, Roop saw us going
towards the front gate!

825
01:07:51,083 --> 01:07:53,499
They would have easily caught
us in their jeeps and bikes!

826
01:07:53,791 --> 01:07:55,665
Now they will go out! They
will call other people too!

827
01:07:55,875 --> 01:07:57,874
They will search everywhere! But
they won't search the house!

828
01:08:01,041 --> 01:08:02,415
So now we will wait here!

829
01:08:03,208 --> 01:08:05,665
Then at the right time we will
leave from the backyard..

830
01:08:05,875 --> 01:08:07,957
.. and reach the taxi stand
on the other side. Got it?

831
01:08:09,791 --> 01:08:12,415
You had even planned to elope
with that photograph girl?

832
01:08:17,666 --> 01:08:20,415
Come on, Hurry up.
- Have faith in God!

833
01:08:20,666 --> 01:08:22,999
She told us everything!
Why did she hide this?

834
01:08:23,208 --> 01:08:25,207
All this is that Aditya's doing!
He only has corrupted Geet's mind!

835
01:08:25,416 --> 01:08:27,665
Listen! Carefully!
- lt's all his doing!

836
01:08:27,875 --> 01:08:30,957
You have high BP! He stayed with us!
- He even ate with us!

837
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,999
Don't get so angry!
- lf l catch him, l won't spare him!

838
01:08:34,666 --> 01:08:36,999
We will thrash him!
- l will thrash him black and blue!

839
01:08:48,375 --> 01:08:51,874
Where is your boyfriend meeting you?
- ln Manali!

840
01:08:54,416 --> 01:08:56,040
He is not coming to
Bhatinda to meet you?

841
01:08:56,875 --> 01:09:00,665
Actually l have not been
able to speak to him!- No man!

842
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:03,207
Please don't tell me that
the man doesn't even know..

843
01:09:03,416 --> 01:09:04,665
...that you are running away for him!

844
01:09:08,041 --> 01:09:09,040
What are you doing, Geet?

845
01:09:10,041 --> 01:09:11,332
Why are you playing with your life?

846
01:09:11,791 --> 01:09:13,874
Because it's my favourite
game! Life!

847
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,999
What's yours? Football? Badminton?
l know! Car racing! Right?

848
01:09:18,791 --> 01:09:21,665
You know.. l used to think that
there are many problems in my life!

849
01:09:22,875 --> 01:09:24,207
Now how to get out of this problem?

850
01:09:25,166 --> 01:09:27,790
You are so selfish! You are
thinking only about yourself!

851
01:09:28,041 --> 01:09:28,540
What about me?

852
01:09:28,666 --> 01:09:32,040
What about you? This is your
life! lt's your plan!

853
01:09:32,083 --> 01:09:34,207
You are going to elope!
What am l doing here?

854
01:09:34,416 --> 01:09:36,207
l mean, l am taking the risk of
running away with the girl!

855
01:09:36,416 --> 01:09:39,874
People are looking to murder me!
And l don't even get the girl! Great!

856
01:09:40,583 --> 01:09:42,790
l told you to elope with Roop!

857
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,665
You are having fun! Right?

858
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,665
Uncle has gone to the
railway station!

859
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,999
Has asked should we inform the police?
- No! Don't inform the police!

860
01:10:03,208 --> 01:10:05,207
You have to go to school!
So go to sleep!

861
01:10:05,416 --> 01:10:08,665
Fine! l will check the bus stand!
- Take my cell along!

862
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,040
Don't worry! Everything
will be fine! Just watch!

863
01:10:19,041 --> 01:10:20,582
You are consoling me, Geet?

864
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,124
l will just take a flight
and go away from all this!

865
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:25,415
What about you?

866
01:10:25,666 --> 01:10:28,999
The way you are handling your life
you can get into a grave problem, Geet!

867
01:10:29,208 --> 01:10:30,207
Do you realise that?

868
01:10:30,666 --> 01:10:33,082
Life is not just about fun
and merriment, Geet!

869
01:10:33,333 --> 01:10:35,415
You have to be serious in life too!

870
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:38,874
Aditya, you were very
serious in life!

871
01:10:39,666 --> 01:10:43,874
What was the use?
You got into a grave trouble too!

872
01:10:46,666 --> 01:10:50,332
What is going to happen
in the future..

873
01:10:50,583 --> 01:10:53,082
So l do what my heart tells me!

874
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,665
ln the future l don't
want to blame anybody!

875
01:10:56,041 --> 01:10:57,999
That my life got ruined
because of you!

876
01:10:58,666 --> 01:11:00,082
No matter what my life becomes..

877
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:03,665
l will know it's like this because of me!
So l will be happy!

878
01:11:06,416 --> 01:11:07,999
Too much philosophy, right?

879
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,874
These moments.. which we
are spending together..

880
01:11:15,291 --> 01:11:16,665
its really a lovely time.

881
01:11:17,208 --> 01:11:20,582
Just watch! ln the future we
will remember this and laugh!

882
01:11:40,666 --> 01:11:41,999
l will return very soon!

883
01:11:42,875 --> 01:11:46,207
Soon as l get married and with Anshuman
l will fall at their feet!

884
01:11:47,791 --> 01:11:51,874
They will scold me, taunt me.
Then they will give their consent.

885
01:11:54,208 --> 01:11:54,874
Let's go.

886
01:11:56,333 --> 01:11:59,999
Tell me the truth. What
l am doing. ls it right?

887
01:12:04,875 --> 01:12:07,499
No! What you are doing is not right.

888
01:12:09,208 --> 01:12:12,999
But you only had said.. that
when somebody is in love..

889
01:12:13,333 --> 01:12:14,665
.. there is no right or wrong.

890
01:12:15,416 --> 01:12:16,415
All is fair.

891
01:12:19,208 --> 01:12:23,999
And if today l can understand
my mother.. then don't worry.

892
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:28,207
ln the future your parents
will understand you.

893
01:12:38,791 --> 01:12:39,415
Come on!

894
01:13:01,208 --> 01:13:07,665
There is some reason.
That l am enjoying my life like this.

895
01:13:09,416 --> 01:13:15,957
What is in the breeze?
That a slight intoxication has entered me.

896
01:13:17,666 --> 01:13:33,082
Don't ask what has happened to me.
Coming in your path.

897
01:13:33,666 --> 01:13:39,999
This love gives you
a glimpse of heaven.

898
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:48,249
O God! This love gives you
a glimpse of heaven.

899
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:22,957
l have broken all the
bondages of the world.

900
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:26,207
l won't break my promise.

901
01:14:26,666 --> 01:14:34,874
You are half the part of the tale of my heart.
l am the other half, beloved.

902
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:42,999
Look, what has happened to me.
Lost in your memories.

903
01:14:43,208 --> 01:14:50,999
Don't ask what has happened to me.
Living in your talks.

904
01:14:51,208 --> 01:14:57,665
This love gives you
a glimpse of heaven.

905
01:14:58,041 --> 01:15:05,999
O God! This love gives you
a glimpse of heaven.

906
01:15:33,791 --> 01:15:41,665
You must have found countless like me,
beloved. But l found only you.

907
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:49,874
You are the blossoming smile on my lips.
My complaint is you too.

908
01:15:50,208 --> 01:15:57,415
Look what has happened to me.
Bringing you in my dreams.

909
01:15:58,333 --> 01:16:06,332
Don't ask what has happened to me.
Believing your talks.

910
01:16:06,583 --> 01:16:12,999
This love gives you
a glimpse of heaven.

911
01:16:13,208 --> 01:16:21,332
O God! This love gives you
a glimpse of heaven.

912
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:29,040
There is some reason.
That's why l am enjoying my life like this.

913
01:16:30,666 --> 01:16:37,082
What is in the breeze?
That a slight intoxication has entered me.

914
01:16:39,208 --> 01:16:47,207
Don't ask what has happened to me.
Coming in your arms.

915
01:16:47,416 --> 01:16:54,999
Don't ask what l will get.
Coming in your arms.

916
01:16:55,208 --> 01:17:01,874
This love gives you
a glimpse of heaven.

917
01:17:02,041 --> 01:17:02,999
O God!

918
01:17:03,375 --> 01:17:18,082
This love gives you
a glimpse of heaven.

919
01:17:19,416 --> 01:17:24,415
Look! Anshuman! Anshuman!
He is looking the other way!

920
01:17:26,166 --> 01:17:29,415
Come on!- Bye, Geet!

921
01:17:30,041 --> 01:17:34,415
What? -Always be like this!

922
01:17:36,166 --> 01:17:37,290
At least meet him!

923
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:46,665
Geet..

924
01:17:53,625 --> 01:17:54,415
Take care!

925
01:19:07,416 --> 01:19:09,874
Good morning.
- Good morning. - Good morning.

926
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:15,665
You are all not going to beat
me up together, right?

927
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,665
Mr. Mehra, please don't hit me.

928
01:19:22,166 --> 01:19:23,999
l know l have done something
for which l should be beaten.

929
01:19:24,208 --> 01:19:25,207
l went without informing anyone..

930
01:19:25,416 --> 01:19:27,415
The company was already
in a bad condition.

931
01:19:27,666 --> 01:19:29,499
And on top of that there
was me and my loneliness.

932
01:19:30,583 --> 01:19:33,124
l know that there are rumours spread..
about me in the market.

933
01:19:33,958 --> 01:19:35,790
Aditya Kashyap cannot
replace his father..

934
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:37,790
The company is going to split.

935
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,415
His girlfriend has married
someone else..

936
01:19:39,666 --> 01:19:42,207
He has ran away from the city, etc.

937
01:19:42,416 --> 01:19:47,874
These are all false rumours which
by the way are all true.

938
01:19:50,333 --> 01:19:53,124
So our share prices are
at an all time low..

939
01:19:53,333 --> 01:19:56,874
All our new brands have flopped.
On top of that 572 claims..

940
01:19:57,041 --> 01:19:58,999
ln other words we are in
a very bad condition.

941
01:19:59,208 --> 01:20:02,415
Sir, you are ruined. Nothing
can be worse than this.

942
01:20:02,666 --> 01:20:04,665
So only good things
can happen and will happen.

943
01:20:05,875 --> 01:20:10,415
lf a human being wants something..
.. actually, he gets that.

944
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:14,207
This time l want real. ln actual..

945
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,957
And l really want to face
all these problems.

946
01:20:17,208 --> 01:20:19,082
l want to complete all
the incomplete plans..

947
01:20:19,333 --> 01:20:22,415
Take this company to such heights..
.. which even dad could not imagine.

948
01:20:24,208 --> 01:20:31,749
l know all of you loved dad a lot.
He is somewhere, watching us.

949
01:20:33,041 --> 01:20:36,415
So let us show him that
no need to be too proud.

950
01:20:36,666 --> 01:20:37,999
This company can perform
without you.

951
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:39,999
And can perform better
than your expectations.

952
01:20:40,208 --> 01:20:42,415
Let's show him. What do you say?

953
01:20:57,125 --> 01:21:01,415
Mrs. Khanna doesn't want to entertain
any settlement at this stage.

954
01:21:02,416 --> 01:21:05,665
She is here only to honour the
request of this meeting.

955
01:21:06,416 --> 01:21:11,665
She thinks that Mr. Aditya has
behaved very inappropriately.

956
01:21:11,875 --> 01:21:13,790
So there is no further room for negotiation.

957
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,999
My God, you talk a lot. You
enjoy talking don't you?

958
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,999
Do you know l have been meeting people
just like you since the last few days.

959
01:21:23,208 --> 01:21:24,207
Excuse me.

960
01:21:25,208 --> 01:21:28,207
This is your client's claim, right?
l am ready to sign it.

961
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:30,499
Your work is over.

962
01:21:31,041 --> 01:21:32,999
Take it easy. Relax.
Take a chill pill.

963
01:21:33,208 --> 01:21:34,665
Listen, take care of sir.

964
01:21:34,875 --> 01:21:36,999
And listen, ask him what is
his monthly phone bill?

965
01:21:37,208 --> 01:21:39,874
Sir, please.
- Mrs. Khanna.

966
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:43,665
lt is your personal matter
what you have done..

967
01:21:45,041 --> 01:21:49,749
.. with your family and husband
in your personal life.

968
01:21:51,416 --> 01:21:53,499
This company is not
concerned with it.

969
01:21:56,041 --> 01:21:58,665
For that reason, l can't take
away your life long hard work.

970
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:03,665
You and Mr. Kashyap had started
this company in a small room.

971
01:22:05,083 --> 01:22:08,582
and after 30 years of hard work you
have made this company what it is.

972
01:22:11,583 --> 01:22:17,999
No one can give you these 5 things.

973
01:22:22,208 --> 01:22:24,499
This company belongs to you
as much as it belongs to me.

974
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:29,290
And l want you to have the
same position, respect..

975
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:35,665
.. and responsibilities you held
5 years ago. ls that okay?

976
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:42,665
Raghav, get the papers ready.
l want to sign them in an hour. - Sure!

977
01:22:44,666 --> 01:22:45,665
Welcome back.

978
01:22:53,416 --> 01:22:56,874
Sir, what is your STD bill.
- l don't want to discuss..

979
01:22:57,041 --> 01:22:59,790
Listen, request an itemised bill.
lt's very important. -Okay, sir.

980
01:23:01,416 --> 01:23:03,957
Mehek.
- Yes, sir. Call our telecom team.

981
01:23:04,125 --> 01:23:06,415
l have a new idea product idea.
ASAP. Okay. - Sir.

982
01:23:06,666 --> 01:23:09,415
And what else l am afraid
of? Stake owners.

983
01:23:09,666 --> 01:23:13,207
l want a meeting with the stake
owners tomorrow morning.

984
01:23:13,416 --> 01:23:14,207
l just want to see the expression
on their faces..

985
01:23:14,416 --> 01:23:15,999
when they realise that mom is back.
After that l will place my terms with them.

986
01:23:16,208 --> 01:23:18,582
- Yes, sir. Adi.
- Yes. What happened?

987
01:23:18,791 --> 01:23:20,040
You tell me what has happened?

988
01:23:20,666 --> 01:23:21,999
You went to Manali right.
- Yes.

989
01:23:22,083 --> 01:23:24,207
Did you pray to Lord
Shiva out there?

990
01:23:25,041 --> 01:23:28,040
Correct. You are right. - There
is something. And it is serious.

991
01:23:28,083 --> 01:23:31,874
l fear that you will solve
all your problems this way.

992
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,874
You are working more in a day then
you used to work in 6 months.

993
01:23:35,666 --> 01:23:37,207
Don't you care about
your reputation?

994
01:23:37,791 --> 01:23:39,415
What's wrong with you, friend?

995
01:23:40,875 --> 01:23:43,665
What's wrong with me? How
can l forget? - What?

996
01:23:44,333 --> 01:23:46,957
The most important work.
- Annual report. - No.

997
01:23:47,666 --> 01:23:48,874
l will meet you.

998
01:23:50,875 --> 01:23:51,999
Good morning.

999
01:24:22,208 --> 01:24:32,207
Nothing is gained.
Nothing is lost.

1000
01:24:36,083 --> 01:24:43,665
Your absence is like..
.. your presence.

1001
01:24:44,208 --> 01:24:58,499
The day starts with you.
The dusky evening approaches.

1002
01:24:58,666 --> 01:25:02,665
From you. From you.

1003
01:25:02,875 --> 01:25:09,457
Every moment, every breath
And the life that l have is

1004
01:25:09,666 --> 01:25:13,665
From you. From you.

1005
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:26,790
Nothing is gained.
Nothing is lost.

1006
01:25:27,791 --> 01:25:41,749
Your absence is..
like your presence.

1007
01:25:59,041 --> 01:26:05,999
My eyes stare into your eyes.
My arms are in your arms.

1008
01:26:06,208 --> 01:26:13,207
l have nothing of me in me.
What happened?

1009
01:26:13,666 --> 01:26:16,999
My talks are filled
with your talks.

1010
01:26:17,208 --> 01:26:25,415
The nights are filled with your stories.
Why has all this become yours?

1011
01:26:25,666 --> 01:26:27,665
What happened?

1012
01:26:27,875 --> 01:26:34,415
Wherever l go, l'm never far..

1013
01:26:34,666 --> 01:26:38,665
From you. From you.

1014
01:26:38,875 --> 01:26:45,665
There is a silence in the bustle.
There is a little delirium.

1015
01:26:45,958 --> 01:26:49,374
From you. From you.

1016
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:04,999
Somewhere a half done promise.
Somewhere more than a half.

1017
01:27:05,291 --> 01:27:12,332
l feel like making
to you, of loyalty.

1018
01:27:12,666 --> 01:27:19,874
Can't leave it even if l want to.
Can't break it even if l want to.

1019
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:26,874
The way l am connected
to you with loyalty.

1020
01:27:27,041 --> 01:27:33,665
l am what you made me.
Whatever l have become is.

1021
01:27:33,875 --> 01:27:37,749
From you. From you.

1022
01:27:37,958 --> 01:27:44,665
Roads meet. Destinations are found.

1023
01:27:44,875 --> 01:27:48,874
From you. From you.

1024
01:27:49,000 --> 01:28:02,165
Nothing is gained.
Nothing is lost.

1025
01:28:03,041 --> 01:28:17,249
Your absence is like..
your presence.

1026
01:28:32,791 --> 01:28:36,665
The country's first long distance
calling card, 'Geet'.

1027
01:28:37,416 --> 01:28:40,415
For people who like to talk more.

1028
01:28:40,666 --> 01:28:43,790
Excuse me, sir, how did you get the
idea of the lndia calling card?

1029
01:28:44,166 --> 01:28:46,332
The world is getting smaller
and lndia is becoming bigger.

1030
01:28:46,583 --> 01:28:47,999
We talk to the entire world today.

1031
01:28:48,208 --> 01:28:51,290
The idea is to let people talk enough to
fill up their hearts, not their bills.

1032
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:52,999
We will call them up.
Doesn't really matter.

1033
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,415
All that matters is that
the terms are met.

1034
01:28:54,666 --> 01:28:57,082
So please request him tomorrow for a
meeting. Any time after lunch.

1035
01:28:57,416 --> 01:29:03,999
Excuse me.
- Who are you? - Excuse me.

1036
01:29:04,208 --> 01:29:07,874
One second. One second.
- Scoundrel! Rascal!

1037
01:29:09,041 --> 01:29:13,540
Sorry. Greetings. Hi Roop?

1038
01:29:13,833 --> 01:29:17,665
Where is she? Where is Geet?

1039
01:29:19,416 --> 01:29:21,207
Tell me. Why are you looking
at me like that?

1040
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,749
Tell me where she is?

1041
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,415
Call her here. We need
to talk to her.

1042
01:29:30,208 --> 01:29:35,999
Uncle, Geet is not with me.
- Go away. Stop doing this drama..

1043
01:29:37,041 --> 01:29:38,999
We met by chance in a train.

1044
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,665
We didn't even know
each other before.

1045
01:29:42,041 --> 01:29:45,874
Manjeet has told us everything.
He has seen you and Geet together.

1046
01:29:48,875 --> 01:29:51,207
Roop has also seen you
eloping with her.

1047
01:29:51,791 --> 01:29:55,332
Still you are denying. Are we fools?

1048
01:29:57,250 --> 01:29:59,707
Uncle, l can understand your emotion

1049
01:29:59,875 --> 01:30:03,332
Pick up the phone and call her
here. Pick up the phone.

1050
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,582
Let me explain..
- Look.

1051
01:30:07,791 --> 01:30:09,415
Everything was explained
when you launched..

1052
01:30:09,666 --> 01:30:12,665
the calling card with
her name, Geet.

1053
01:30:12,875 --> 01:30:16,332
Didn't you announce it to
the entire world? Speak up!

1054
01:30:17,958 --> 01:30:19,165
Trying to fool me.

1055
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:24,874
Uncle, listen to me please.
- Listen to me son.

1056
01:30:25,458 --> 01:30:28,457
Everyone knows that you left
for Bhatinda together.

1057
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,707
And now you are saying that
she is not with you. Tell me the truth..

1058
01:30:32,041 --> 01:30:33,374
Tell me the truth., has something
happened to her?

1059
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:37,124
ls she no longer alive?
- Uncle - Tell me son, tell me.

1060
01:30:37,583 --> 01:30:38,415
What are you saying, uncle?

1061
01:30:38,666 --> 01:30:41,749
Because Geet not talking to us
for 9 months is not possible.

1062
01:30:42,541 --> 01:30:46,082
9 months. l know something has happened.
She couldn't even wait for 9 hours.

1063
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:50,249
Uncle, nothing has happened
to Geet. She is fine.

1064
01:30:51,208 --> 01:30:52,415
How do you know?

1065
01:30:54,333 --> 01:30:59,665
l know. Uncle, Geet is absolutely fine.
Nothing has happened to her.

1066
01:30:59,875 --> 01:31:04,874
This means she is with you, right.
- She is with you, isn't it?

1067
01:31:07,333 --> 01:31:10,665
Yes, she is with me.
- See. Call her here.

1068
01:31:11,125 --> 01:31:16,999
We need to talk to her now.
- She is not in Bombay now.

1069
01:31:17,208 --> 01:31:20,499
Well done. You'll say it
and we'll believe it?

1070
01:31:20,875 --> 01:31:27,207
Yes. Believe it. Uncle,
l will bring Geet home. -When?

1071
01:31:30,166 --> 01:31:33,290
ln 1 0 days. - We won't leave
this place. 1 0 days indeed.

1072
01:31:34,208 --> 01:31:37,999
l promise you uncle, in 1 0 days
l will bring Geet to Bhatinda.

1073
01:31:38,416 --> 01:31:42,082
All right, l will wait. - Brother,
it is nothing but a waste of time.

1074
01:31:42,458 --> 01:31:47,999
He is fooling us.
-1 0 days?- Yes.

1075
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,874
Should l ask you or
can you read my mind?

1076
01:32:04,291 --> 01:32:05,290
l am going to Manali.

1077
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,999
Sir.
- Thank you.

1078
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:43,040
Anshuman.
- Yes.

1079
01:32:44,666 --> 01:32:45,999
Hi, l am Aditya.

1080
01:32:46,416 --> 01:32:49,499
We have never met but you
may have heard about me.

1081
01:32:50,041 --> 01:32:56,665
Aditya Kashyap.

1082
01:32:57,416 --> 01:33:00,999
By the way l have also heard a
lot about you from same source.

1083
01:33:01,208 --> 01:33:04,665
A small gift for you and
your family. - Thank you.

1084
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,207
Please.
- Thank you.

1085
01:33:09,875 --> 01:33:10,665
So?

1086
01:33:13,166 --> 01:33:17,415
Actually Geet's family
is a little worried.

1087
01:33:17,666 --> 01:33:21,165
She said that you guys will return
to Bhatinda after getting married.

1088
01:33:21,208 --> 01:33:25,874
But l guess it never happened-Who?

1089
01:33:28,041 --> 01:33:28,540
What?

1090
01:33:28,875 --> 01:33:32,874
Who told you that after marriage.. -Geet.

1091
01:33:33,416 --> 01:33:34,957
Which Geet are you talking about?

1092
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:43,499
How many Geets do you know, friend?
- l don't know any Geet.

1093
01:33:47,666 --> 01:33:48,332
Geet.

1094
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,040
Take care.

1095
01:34:06,083 --> 01:34:10,957
You have.. How Anshuman?

1096
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,665
How can you do this?

1097
01:34:15,166 --> 01:34:16,665
Don't make me feel guilty.

1098
01:34:17,333 --> 01:34:20,207
l didn't tell her to run away
from home. Understand?

1099
01:34:20,791 --> 01:34:22,499
Still she came to
meet you, Anshuman.

1100
01:34:23,416 --> 01:34:26,415
After leaving her entire
world behind. Why?

1101
01:34:26,666 --> 01:34:29,665
Because she is crazy.
You know her..

1102
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,040
So you would know that
she is very childish.

1103
01:34:33,208 --> 01:34:34,665
She lives in a world of dreams.

1104
01:34:34,875 --> 01:34:37,415
She thinks that everything will
happen the way she wants.

1105
01:34:39,875 --> 01:34:42,415
And you proved to her that her
world of dreams doesn't exist.

1106
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:44,790
Because people like you live here.

1107
01:34:45,666 --> 01:34:50,207
Look sir, you are a very big man.
But this my personal issue.

1108
01:34:50,416 --> 01:34:53,790
l don't think l need to
explain anything to you. -Right.

1109
01:34:55,666 --> 01:34:58,207
What is there to explain after
what you have done to her?

1110
01:34:59,125 --> 01:34:59,957
Everything is clear.

1111
01:35:01,333 --> 01:35:03,749
But its not clear why
you are doing here?

1112
01:35:04,875 --> 01:35:09,207
Geet never said that she knew you
but still you came so far looking for her.

1113
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:10,999
What's the scene, mister?

1114
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:21,415
l would have told you what the scene
between me and Geet is Anshuman.

1115
01:35:22,583 --> 01:35:25,332
But a cheap man like you
will never understand it.

1116
01:35:25,875 --> 01:35:32,207
What? What did you say?
- Cheap. Bad. Lowly.

1117
01:35:34,416 --> 01:35:35,415
What bad have l done?

1118
01:35:36,875 --> 01:35:39,040
You are speaking as if l had
promised her marriage..

1119
01:35:39,083 --> 01:35:40,207
and taken advantage of her.

1120
01:35:40,666 --> 01:35:44,415
l had not even mentioned marriage.
She was crazy about it.

1121
01:35:44,791 --> 01:35:47,957
We will do this and that after
marriage. This house.

1122
01:35:48,125 --> 01:35:56,665
Such a balcony. Such curtains. Fool!
l told her to go back to Bhatinda.

1123
01:35:57,041 --> 01:35:59,082
l used to tell her the same when
she used to call me from Shimla.

1124
01:35:59,583 --> 01:36:02,790
But she never listened
to me. Then go ahead.

1125
01:36:03,041 --> 01:36:03,999
lt makes no difference to me.

1126
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,874
Geet has not come home since
the last 9 months, Anshuman.

1127
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,207
She is alone somewhere.

1128
01:36:08,416 --> 01:36:13,665
Who knows how she is and in what condition.
And just because you refused her.

1129
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:17,874
And if it doesn't make any
difference to you, Anshuman.

1130
01:36:18,208 --> 01:36:18,999
Then that is right for her.

1131
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:23,790
She should be punished that she
loved a man like you so much.

1132
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:26,999
Anshuman.

1133
01:37:05,416 --> 01:37:18,624
When you will come, darling.
When you will come, darling.

1134
01:37:19,416 --> 01:37:24,790
Flowers will bloom in the garden.

1135
01:37:25,416 --> 01:37:40,665
lt will rain. lt will rain heavily.
The two hearts will meet like this.

1136
01:37:41,416 --> 01:37:51,415
When you will come, darling.
Flowers will bloom in the garden.

1137
01:38:27,041 --> 01:38:34,665
Your eyes are filled with kohl.
l am smitten by your eyes,

1138
01:38:35,166 --> 01:38:42,874
These strange eyes of yours
had made many promises.

1139
01:38:44,166 --> 01:38:52,999
The whiff of breath blows softly.
When they stop it will rain.

1140
01:38:53,416 --> 01:39:03,415
lt will rain heavily.
The two hearts will meet like this.

1141
01:39:05,416 --> 01:39:15,415
When you will come, darling.
Flowers will bloom in the garden.

1142
01:39:57,166 --> 01:40:04,874
ln the night filled with moon and stars.
My life is in your hands now.

1143
01:40:05,041 --> 01:40:11,999
There are twinkling stars in my eyes.
With rain filled with hailstorms.

1144
01:40:12,208 --> 01:40:19,207
The world of dreams
will be blooming.

1145
01:40:19,416 --> 01:40:34,082
lt will rain. lt will rain heavily.
The two hearts will meet like this.

1146
01:41:01,416 --> 01:41:06,957
So Ti La So Fa Mi, La,
La, La Mi Re.

1147
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:13,999

1148
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:21,999

1149
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:34,665
Hi. What a surprise? What
are you doing here?

1150
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,957
Just like that. l came to
know you are here so..

1151
01:41:39,416 --> 01:41:45,332
So how are you?
- Good. - Yes? - Yes.

1152
01:41:46,083 --> 01:41:50,957
Great. And the rest?
- And the rest is all fine.

1153
01:41:53,666 --> 01:41:55,082
You have hurt me a lot Geet.

1154
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:05,207
Couldn't you tell me? Couldn't
you call me up once?

1155
01:42:08,041 --> 01:42:10,499
Pack your luggage and come with me.

1156
01:42:13,041 --> 01:42:13,999
Go away, Aditya.

1157
01:42:14,208 --> 01:42:16,082
Look Geet, l am very angry now.

1158
01:42:16,791 --> 01:42:20,999
Don't make me angrier,
all right? Come on. -No, Aditya.

1159
01:42:22,458 --> 01:42:26,874
l will stay in the life
l have made for me.

1160
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,207
You know what Geet.

1161
01:42:28,583 --> 01:42:31,665
Keep your fable stories
philosophy with you.

1162
01:42:31,875 --> 01:42:36,040
Right now you are coming with me.
- You cannot force me, Aditya.

1163
01:42:36,083 --> 01:42:37,082
Of course l can Geet.

1164
01:42:39,791 --> 01:42:42,415
Geet you are coming with me.
- Damn it, Aditya, let me go.

1165
01:42:42,666 --> 01:42:44,999
What are you doing?
l told you, let me go.

1166
01:42:45,208 --> 01:42:47,957
Get listen to me, you are coming with..
- Who do you think you are?

1167
01:42:49,791 --> 01:42:51,207
Just because this happened
to me it doesn't mean..

1168
01:42:51,416 --> 01:42:53,415
.. that it's your chance
now. Understand?

1169
01:42:57,208 --> 01:42:59,999
l understood. l will
keep that in mind.

1170
01:43:00,666 --> 01:43:01,665
Can we leave now?

1171
01:43:04,125 --> 01:43:06,124
Why are you doing all this?

1172
01:43:06,333 --> 01:43:07,999
lt is not necessary to tell
you the reason, Geet.

1173
01:43:08,208 --> 01:43:09,415
Fetch your luggage and let's go.

1174
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:17,499
No, Aditya, l can't take
more favours from you.

1175
01:43:19,416 --> 01:43:24,165
You have already done a lot
for me. So just forget it.

1176
01:43:24,208 --> 01:43:28,957
l have done a lot for you.
l have done a lot for you.

1177
01:43:29,875 --> 01:43:32,665
l am alive today just because
of you. You fool.

1178
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,874
This is my second life which
you have given me.

1179
01:43:37,333 --> 01:43:39,040
Do you know how successful
l am today?

1180
01:43:39,416 --> 01:43:42,415
Today my company is at a higher
position than at dad's time.

1181
01:43:42,666 --> 01:43:45,415
l have started 3 new industries,
launched many brands.

1182
01:43:45,666 --> 01:43:46,999
Everything is going great.

1183
01:43:47,208 --> 01:43:49,957
And what l am today is just
because of you, Geet.

1184
01:43:51,291 --> 01:43:52,999
Whenever l am in a problem
l used to think..

1185
01:43:53,208 --> 01:43:56,999
what would Geet do if she
were here and l do that. And you..

1186
01:44:00,875 --> 01:44:02,999
Shall we go now or do you
want some more drama?

1187
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,957
This is my life. Go away from here.
Leave me alone, etc.

1188
01:44:14,208 --> 01:44:15,082
l am coming.

1189
01:44:36,666 --> 01:44:37,874
Take out the luggage.

1190
01:44:52,333 --> 01:44:56,290
So, you stay here, l will
take another room.

1191
01:44:57,208 --> 01:45:00,290
What is the need? lt
is such a big room.

1192
01:45:03,083 --> 01:45:06,874
All right. Anyways l know karate.

1193
01:45:07,416 --> 01:45:08,957
So there shouldn't be any problem.

1194
01:45:11,416 --> 01:45:16,082
Don't worry, l won't rape you.
- You can't.

1195
01:45:17,416 --> 01:45:19,957
l don't want to rape you.
- Even if you want to you can't.

1196
01:45:23,583 --> 01:45:27,415
My God. What a night it was.
Do you remember that hotel?

1197
01:45:27,666 --> 01:45:34,499
Yes, hotel Decent. - Decent.

1198
01:45:35,666 --> 01:45:36,999
By the way let me
tell you one thing.

1199
01:45:37,750 --> 01:45:41,874
That night everyone in hotel Decent..
.. thought you to be a call girl.

1200
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:46,415
What? Call girl!
- l was going to use a worse word.

1201
01:45:46,666 --> 01:45:49,040
What nonsense? Really?

1202
01:45:49,291 --> 01:45:53,415
Remember when l told you that
let me talk but you were you.

1203
01:45:54,041 --> 01:46:02,957
Oh dear! Oh God! l was such a fool.
What a fool l was.

1204
01:46:04,666 --> 01:46:06,207
That's why all this
is happening to me.

1205
01:46:08,875 --> 01:46:10,665
That's why l am in such a condition.

1206
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:22,415
What have l done?
Where am l trapped?

1207
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:31,207
l always keep on thinking
of what l should do next.

1208
01:46:32,791 --> 01:46:34,874
What do l tell him that he agrees?

1209
01:46:38,666 --> 01:46:39,999
l don't understand.

1210
01:46:44,041 --> 01:46:45,874
l used to call him a lot.

1211
01:47:02,416 --> 01:47:03,999
l will tell you what you should do.

1212
01:47:04,208 --> 01:47:06,749
Throw Anshuman out of
your life. Understand?

1213
01:47:08,291 --> 01:47:11,582
No matter how much you cry,
he won't come back Geet.

1214
01:47:11,791 --> 01:47:14,415
He would have returned long
back if he wanted to.

1215
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,957
Geet he is not even thinking about you
He is happy in his life.

1216
01:47:22,041 --> 01:47:24,874
You met him?- Yes.

1217
01:47:25,166 --> 01:47:26,415
What was he saying?

1218
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:38,207
Geet, Anshuman's chapter is over.

1219
01:47:39,875 --> 01:47:45,207
That is the truth. And it is
good for you to believe it.

1220
01:47:46,875 --> 01:47:51,499
The way he threw you out of his life,
just throw him out of your life.

1221
01:47:52,416 --> 01:47:54,665
Photograph. His photograph.

1222
01:47:54,875 --> 01:47:58,207
Burn his photograph and throw
him out of your life.

1223
01:47:59,333 --> 01:48:02,874
Give me his photo.
- l don't have one. - Shit.

1224
01:48:03,333 --> 01:48:07,207
Okay, we will call him and you
will abuse him. Even better.

1225
01:48:07,416 --> 01:48:11,207
Abuse him all you want.
- Aditya please.

1226
01:48:11,416 --> 01:48:18,999
lt is childish? Great, be childish. Abuse him
Take out your anger. You will feel fantastic.

1227
01:48:20,416 --> 01:48:20,999
Listen.

1228
01:48:25,041 --> 01:48:28,207
Aditya, listen. Aditya.

1229
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,999
lt is ringing. Get ready. Abuse
him all you want, okay?

1230
01:48:33,208 --> 01:48:37,874
Please. - Hello. - Hello.
Anshuman? One second.

1231
01:48:40,666 --> 01:48:46,874
Come on. Come on just go for it.
- Hello? - Come on.

1232
01:48:47,208 --> 01:48:50,415
Hello. - Yes.
- Hello, Anshuman?

1233
01:48:50,666 --> 01:48:51,207
Geet?

1234
01:48:51,666 --> 01:48:53,207
Yes.
- Abuse him.

1235
01:48:53,416 --> 01:48:55,790
Was that Aditya Kashyap's voice?

1236
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,874
Yes.
- Hello. - Come on.

1237
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,415
Anshuman, l wanted to say that..
- Tell me, Geet.

1238
01:49:03,875 --> 01:49:07,999
Don't think. Don't think. Just
say it. - Hello. - Dog. - Yes.

1239
01:49:08,208 --> 01:49:08,874
What?

1240
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:16,415
Dog. Fool! - Hello, Geet. -
Fantastic. - You scoundrel.

1241
01:49:16,666 --> 01:49:19,957
Fantastic!
- You child of a pig.

1242
01:49:20,791 --> 01:49:23,999
Did you think that l will suffer for
you my entire life if you leave me?

1243
01:49:24,208 --> 01:49:25,665
You will suffer, you rascal.
- Geet!

1244
01:49:25,875 --> 01:49:27,207
Worms will eat you. You
will die a dog's death

1245
01:49:27,416 --> 01:49:32,957
And after dying you will roast
in hell fire forever, rascal.

1246
01:49:39,791 --> 01:49:40,665
Are you feeling better?

1247
01:49:42,666 --> 01:49:44,999
Yes.
- Yes. l am feeling very nice.

1248
01:49:48,208 --> 01:49:50,999
Thanks. -Any time.

1249
01:50:41,666 --> 01:50:43,207
lt is okay. lt happens sometimes.

1250
01:50:44,125 --> 01:50:49,165
lt won't happen in the future.
Nothing to worry about.

1251
01:50:49,791 --> 01:50:53,290
l am very hungry. What is
there to eat? l will see.

1252
01:51:08,125 --> 01:51:09,999
And tomorrow you will take me
around Shimla, understand?

1253
01:51:12,416 --> 01:51:14,790
Don't be embarrassed, friend.
What has happened?

1254
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:20,207
Nothing. Come. Let's eat something.
Tomorrow we have to go out. Come.

1255
01:51:21,416 --> 01:51:24,957
What have you ordered? ls
this something to eat?

1256
01:51:25,208 --> 01:51:28,415
You could have ordered
cottage cheese, fries.

1257
01:51:29,166 --> 01:51:31,415
Or could have ordered
chick peas and bread. You are crazy.

1258
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,665
Come on let's go. We
will miss the train.

1259
01:52:03,041 --> 01:52:04,207
Hurry up, Geet, hurry.

1260
01:52:12,666 --> 01:52:13,665
Give me your hand.

1261
01:52:17,791 --> 01:52:20,999
You know, for many months
l have had nightmares.

1262
01:52:21,208 --> 01:52:27,207
You have caught it now.
- Yes. - Come. Come.

1263
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:38,082
You like me a lot, don't you?

1264
01:52:39,666 --> 01:52:46,665
A lot. l like you a lot.
But that is my problem.

1265
01:52:48,166 --> 01:52:51,207
Anyone can feel the way
they want to. Correct?

1266
01:52:54,791 --> 01:53:01,665
You don't have to worry
about it at all. Okay? Okay?

1267
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,665
Geet, we will leave for Bhatinda
in a little while.

1268
01:53:27,583 --> 01:53:32,665
No.
- Yes. - How will l face them?

1269
01:53:33,041 --> 01:53:35,999
You don't have to face them.
You just have to return home. Come on.

1270
01:53:52,666 --> 01:53:57,332
May l talk to you?
- What is the matter? - 2 minutes.

1271
01:54:02,416 --> 01:54:06,207
There is no use of talking now.
- Please Geet. Let's go somewhere.

1272
01:54:07,208 --> 01:54:10,957
l don't want to talk to you.
- l have made a mistake. Okay.

1273
01:54:11,208 --> 01:54:13,415
l didn't have enough courage
to take you home.

1274
01:54:14,208 --> 01:54:16,415
Since the last 9 months
l have been acting..

1275
01:54:16,875 --> 01:54:19,207
.. as if l am very strong and practical.
Whatever l did was right.

1276
01:54:19,416 --> 01:54:24,874
But the truth is you arrived suddenly that day
and l couldn't handle it. l was scared.

1277
01:54:25,041 --> 01:54:29,999
Mummy, papa, society, religion.
But to hell with everything today.

1278
01:54:30,416 --> 01:54:32,082
lt makes no difference to me now.

1279
01:54:33,875 --> 01:54:35,665
You leave me alone helpless one day.

1280
01:54:36,791 --> 01:54:40,415
And you come after 9 months and
say that l committed a mistake.

1281
01:54:41,875 --> 01:54:42,999
lt's so easy, isn't it?

1282
01:54:43,208 --> 01:54:46,665
No, it is very hard. But
now l will make it easy.

1283
01:54:46,875 --> 01:54:52,082
You have gone through a lot. Now
all your problems are mine.

1284
01:54:52,666 --> 01:54:56,415
Let's go to Bhatinda. l will
talk to mummy and papa.

1285
01:54:56,666 --> 01:54:59,874
l will explain it to them. l will
make everything fine, Geet.

1286
01:55:00,208 --> 01:55:01,665
Everything will be fine.

1287
01:55:11,333 --> 01:55:14,207
Why did he have to come now?
Everything was fine.

1288
01:55:15,416 --> 01:55:20,207
lt is too late. Nothing can
happen now. lt is too late.

1289
01:55:23,875 --> 01:55:28,665
You know Geet my parents
didn't love each other.

1290
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,665
Both of them used to
love other people.

1291
01:55:35,208 --> 01:55:37,499
And because of that l was
pained my entire life.

1292
01:55:39,583 --> 01:55:41,665
They were very good with each
other at work but at home..

1293
01:55:42,791 --> 01:55:51,790
l always used to ask myself,
why did they got married?

1294
01:55:56,666 --> 01:55:58,874
They should have listened
to their heart, Geet.

1295
01:56:01,416 --> 01:56:03,415
And one day everything
would have been fine.

1296
01:56:08,791 --> 01:56:10,874
Just listen to your heart, Geet.

1297
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:15,999
And everything will be fine.
- What do you mean?

1298
01:56:19,583 --> 01:56:27,082
No one will remember these 9 months
after many years pass by.

1299
01:56:29,416 --> 01:56:30,665
Really Aditya.

1300
01:56:32,166 --> 01:56:36,999
l never imagined you
would take his side.

1301
01:56:41,208 --> 01:56:43,207
l am also taking your side, Geet.

1302
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:52,957
You and Anshuman are on the same side.
lt's simple Geet.

1303
01:56:54,791 --> 01:56:58,999
Those who love each other
should remain together.

1304
01:57:00,875 --> 01:57:05,332
Only then everyone will be happy.
- And you?

1305
01:57:09,875 --> 01:57:12,207
Have your first extra
marital affair with me.

1306
01:57:13,041 --> 01:57:14,207
Then l will also be happy.

1307
01:57:18,666 --> 01:57:20,415
Sure. Done.

1308
01:57:28,166 --> 01:57:35,874
No, Aditya. This is not right.
- l wish.

1309
01:57:39,791 --> 01:57:44,999
l wish it was not right. But..

1310
01:57:49,083 --> 01:57:51,999
Come on. Come on.

1311
01:58:36,666 --> 01:58:37,874
This evening. Today!

1312
01:58:39,208 --> 01:58:43,499
You are bringing her. You are
bringing Geet. At what time?

1313
01:58:44,416 --> 01:58:49,207
All right, in the evening. All
right dear. We will wait.

1314
01:58:49,416 --> 01:58:50,874
What is the matter? - Okay.

1315
01:59:09,666 --> 01:59:10,665
Best of luck.

1316
01:59:19,333 --> 01:59:20,749
What is happening here?

1317
01:59:22,208 --> 01:59:23,957
Their girl is returning
home after 9 months.

1318
01:59:46,416 --> 01:59:47,665
Dear!

1319
01:59:48,666 --> 01:59:51,415
Are you all right? Come.

1320
01:59:52,416 --> 01:59:54,874
Son!

1321
01:59:55,666 --> 01:59:58,874
l didn't believe that you
will bring our Geet here.

1322
01:59:59,416 --> 02:00:02,999
But by proving me wrong,
you have won my heart.

1323
02:00:03,208 --> 02:00:05,207
You have made me happy! Thank you!

1324
02:00:05,416 --> 02:00:07,665
God has blessed us! Come, my dear; come.
- Greetings, grandma! Thank God,

1325
02:00:07,875 --> 02:00:09,999
my daughter
has come to her house!

1326
02:00:10,208 --> 02:00:11,665
Here he is!
- Greetings.

1327
02:00:12,416 --> 02:00:13,999
Very good. Very good.

1328
02:00:18,208 --> 02:00:19,332
Well, brother-in-law!

1329
02:00:22,666 --> 02:00:24,499
After all, the secret could
not be kept hidden!

1330
02:00:27,666 --> 02:00:31,415
Oh! Now you can't even
keep your eyes off her? Just wait!

1331
02:00:38,416 --> 02:00:40,207
Here! Are you happy now?

1332
02:00:42,791 --> 02:00:46,415
May you be protected against evil eyes!
Really, they are made for each other!

1333
02:00:47,666 --> 02:00:51,790
Shannu, take this. -Listen, mother!

1334
02:00:53,416 --> 02:00:54,040
Come!

1335
02:00:55,333 --> 02:00:57,874
Hey, look! Someone is
sitting in the car!

1336
02:00:59,666 --> 02:01:03,790
Come. Welcome! Welcome!
Do not feel shy, this is a Punjabi household!

1337
02:01:04,208 --> 02:01:06,665
ls he your friend?
- Aunt, take this.

1338
02:01:07,416 --> 02:01:09,332
Have this sweet.

1339
02:01:10,625 --> 02:01:12,957
Do not eat the whole piece
leave a little.

1340
02:01:13,666 --> 02:01:14,665
Dear, you also eat.
- Mother!

1341
02:01:15,166 --> 02:01:17,415
Eat it. Love strengthens by
eating each other's leftover.

1342
02:01:19,416 --> 02:01:21,999
l think we should tell them.
- Hey, what's going on? What's going on?

1343
02:01:22,208 --> 02:01:27,957
Brother-in-law, control yourself!
- Oh, l am floored! What a smile!

1344
02:01:28,791 --> 02:01:31,415
Shut up, you devil!
Don't trouble them!

1345
02:01:32,666 --> 02:01:35,874
Mother!- Come, dear. Come inside.
Come. Come. One minute.

1346
02:01:36,666 --> 02:01:42,874
'Come. ' 'Come. Come. '
- Hey, not like this!

1347
02:01:43,208 --> 02:01:46,207
You left holding hands; you will
have to enter holding hands too.

1348
02:01:47,958 --> 02:01:50,790
Hey, you are feeling very shy today!

1349
02:01:54,416 --> 02:01:56,040
That's more like it! Come in!

1350
02:02:00,791 --> 02:02:02,124
Mother, l want to
tell you something.

1351
02:02:02,333 --> 02:02:04,665
Dear, go and meet grandpa.
- Please! Now!

1352
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:06,415
Dear, he is waiting for you.

1353
02:02:06,666 --> 02:02:09,040
You have to meet many people
there is a long queue!

1354
02:02:09,083 --> 02:02:12,665
Take them along.
- Brother-in-law, come.

1355
02:02:18,875 --> 02:02:20,790
Greetings, grandpa!- One minute.

1356
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:22,665
One minute.

1357
02:02:25,125 --> 02:02:27,957
When l saw him for the first
time, l had understood.

1358
02:02:28,208 --> 02:02:31,790
At my age, one glance
is enough to realise..

1359
02:02:32,333 --> 02:02:34,665
what is going on between
boy and girl.

1360
02:02:36,041 --> 02:02:38,874
l had asked you. You lied.

1361
02:02:39,125 --> 02:02:43,207
And eloping must have been your idea.
lsn't it? lsn't it?

1362
02:02:44,416 --> 02:02:53,374
Do you see? l knew it. Among the two,
she is the naughty one.

1363
02:02:53,416 --> 02:02:59,082
Anyway a mistake can be forgiven only once.
You have committed your mistake..

1364
02:02:59,625 --> 02:03:00,874
you have been granted
your pardon too.

1365
02:03:01,208 --> 02:03:05,207
ln future, there should be
no shocks! Do you get it?

1366
02:03:13,333 --> 02:03:18,040
Son, be careful! She is the
topmost devil in the family.

1367
02:03:18,666 --> 02:03:22,415
She has troubled us a lot!
She won't spare you too!

1368
02:03:28,416 --> 02:03:29,999
Tell them immediately, everything
will be fine.

1369
02:03:30,208 --> 02:03:31,665
But where is mummy? Hey!

1370
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:35,207
Hello! Listen!
What is going on?

1371
02:03:35,875 --> 02:03:36,415
Everything will be settled.

1372
02:03:36,666 --> 02:03:39,040
Go immediately and talk to mummy.
- You also come.

1373
02:03:39,083 --> 02:03:40,415
Hey, one minute! One minute!

1374
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:42,999
Both of you had eloped, means what?

1375
02:03:43,416 --> 02:03:44,999
Actually.. - When had you
held hands and run away?

1376
02:03:45,208 --> 02:03:46,999
These people have a misconception.
Actually it so happened that..

1377
02:03:47,208 --> 02:03:48,207
Brother-in-law!
Brother-in-law, photo!

1378
02:03:48,416 --> 02:03:50,790
Amrik, listen to me..
- Brother-in-law, photo!

1379
02:03:51,208 --> 02:03:52,999
Brother-in-law, photo! One second Hey,
brother-in-law's friend, will you click a photo?

1380
02:03:55,666 --> 02:03:57,415
From here! From here!

1381
02:03:58,416 --> 02:03:58,999
Dear!

1382
02:04:02,791 --> 02:04:06,957
Ready? We are ready! Click it!

1383
02:04:12,666 --> 02:04:15,207
Hey!- Son, some people have
come to meet you.

1384
02:04:15,416 --> 02:04:16,999
Uncle!
- Call me papa, not uncle.

1385
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:21,415
Son, why don't you go and freshen up?
- No, l am very fresh.

1386
02:04:22,166 --> 02:04:25,082
You have come after a long journey!
- No, l.. Vikram!

1387
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:27,665
No, l am absolutely..
- Come here!

1388
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:31,999
Take brother to the guest room upstairs.
- Son, go and freshen up. - Come, come.

1389
02:04:32,208 --> 02:04:35,999
Have you come to Bhatinda for the first time?
- Geet dear, tell me.

1390
02:04:36,208 --> 02:04:40,374
Look, mummy..
- Dear, first tell me how are you?

1391
02:04:41,750 --> 02:04:45,082
lt has been 9 months.
Are you all right?

1392
02:04:45,791 --> 02:04:47,999
Mummy, don't worry about me;
l am perfectly all right.

1393
02:04:48,208 --> 02:04:50,207
l..
- Does Aditya treat you well?

1394
02:04:50,416 --> 02:04:50,999
lsn't it?

1395
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:54,665
What?

1396
02:04:55,208 --> 02:04:58,415
Yes. - Doesn't he treat you well?

1397
02:05:00,416 --> 02:05:03,415
Well?- Mummy, he cares so much for me!

1398
02:05:05,208 --> 02:05:06,999
Even you have never cared
that much for me.

1399
02:05:07,208 --> 02:05:08,207
Come, my dear!

1400
02:05:09,125 --> 02:05:11,207
What is this hugging game going
on between mother and daughter?

1401
02:05:13,416 --> 02:05:16,999
Tell me now, why did you deceive me?
You were supposed to elope with me..

1402
02:05:17,166 --> 02:05:19,999
.. but you eloped with my sister!
- That's very wrong!

1403
02:05:20,208 --> 02:05:22,874
Brother-in-law, why did
you do this to her?

1404
02:05:23,208 --> 02:05:25,999
What was lacking in me?
- Tell us!

1405
02:05:26,208 --> 02:05:27,415
Do you have an answer?

1406
02:05:28,041 --> 02:05:32,082
lt so happened that..
- What?

1407
02:05:33,291 --> 02:05:36,749
Actually, l made a mistake
in the darkness. -Really?

1408
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:41,415
l thought it was you in the morning
l realised it was your sister!

1409
02:05:41,666 --> 02:05:44,665
Oh God! Your bad luck!

1410
02:05:44,875 --> 02:05:48,415
Well, tell us who is this specimen
you have brought along?

1411
02:05:49,041 --> 02:05:51,207
Who? -Your friend.

1412
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,999
ls he my consolation prize?
ln your place?

1413
02:05:56,041 --> 02:05:57,499
One minute, may l have a seat?

1414
02:05:57,791 --> 02:05:59,665
Hey girls, go away.
Let us talk to him.

1415
02:05:59,875 --> 02:06:00,999
Very good. There is something
we needed to discuss.

1416
02:06:01,208 --> 02:06:01,999
Mummy, let us go inside.

1417
02:06:02,208 --> 02:06:04,415
We want to perform your wedding
ceremony in the Gurudwara.

1418
02:06:04,666 --> 02:06:07,874
Legally you are already married.
This is just for our satisfaction.

1419
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:13,499
Don't look at her. You tell us.
Do you have any objection?

1420
02:06:13,750 --> 02:06:17,999
Then we will not do it. -
lt will be better if you once talk to Geet.

1421
02:06:18,208 --> 02:06:20,332
You don't have any objection,
do you?

1422
02:06:22,041 --> 02:06:24,165
Please talk to Geet first.

1423
02:06:24,208 --> 02:06:27,665
lt's settled then. Very good!
Dear, invite everyone from your side.

1424
02:06:28,041 --> 02:06:29,207
Of course they will come!
His relatives will attend.

1425
02:06:29,416 --> 02:06:31,415
Very good. Great, we should
arrange the marriage soon.

1426
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,874
This is the height! They
have crossed the limit!

1427
02:06:45,791 --> 02:06:47,082
There has been confusion!

1428
02:06:47,333 --> 02:06:49,874
Nobody could have imagined that
something like this could happen!

1429
02:06:50,208 --> 02:06:52,665
But don't worry, ok? Geet
has gone to talk to mummy.

1430
02:06:53,041 --> 02:06:54,957
She should have told as
soon as we arrived!

1431
02:06:55,666 --> 02:06:58,665
Nonsense! All the rituals are
being performed with you..

1432
02:06:58,875 --> 02:07:00,874
and l am being forced
to take a bath in here!

1433
02:07:01,583 --> 02:07:04,207
Enough! Where is Geet? l will
talk to her right now!

1434
02:07:04,416 --> 02:07:07,207
One second! Right now she is
surrounded by many people.

1435
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:09,874
l will call her aside
and talk to her.

1436
02:07:10,666 --> 02:07:13,082
Anshuman, everybody thinks
that you are my friend.

1437
02:07:13,416 --> 02:07:16,207
lt will look odd if you call her aside.
lf it seems odd to them, then let it be so!

1438
02:07:20,875 --> 02:07:28,874
lsn't it the truth that she and l are a couple?
And we have to tell them that only!

1439
02:07:29,583 --> 02:07:31,874
Yes, but let her handle it.

1440
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,499
Look, it is very important to
explain to them properly..

1441
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:38,207
otherwise it can bring dishonour to the family.
There are so many guests.

1442
02:07:40,416 --> 02:07:44,749
These boys want to drag me to have
a look at the sugarcane fields!

1443
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:46,749
Why should l have a look
at sugarcane fields?

1444
02:07:47,166 --> 02:07:48,207
What's so special about
sugarcane fields?

1445
02:07:48,416 --> 02:07:49,874
l don't want to see
sugarcane fields!

1446
02:07:50,041 --> 02:07:52,415
Don't look. Refuse their proposal.
Don't look..

1447
02:07:52,791 --> 02:07:54,999
Don't feel tense. Everything
will be all right, ok?

1448
02:07:55,208 --> 02:07:56,040
Don't worry.

1449
02:08:10,416 --> 02:08:13,874
Shall l tell you something?
Your choice is better than mine.

1450
02:08:15,416 --> 02:08:16,207
Lucky.

1451
02:08:17,125 --> 02:08:19,207
Ok, tell me what did
you want to say?

1452
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:29,499
Look, mummy.. you all are..
l mean..

1453
02:08:31,208 --> 02:08:37,082
what l want to say is..
there is no problem.

1454
02:08:39,166 --> 02:08:47,999
Everything is fine.
But here.. all this..

1455
02:08:53,291 --> 02:08:55,040
l want to lie down for a while.

1456
02:08:55,875 --> 02:09:01,999
Sure, dear. You are very tired, aren't you?
Take rest for some time.

1457
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:03,874
Go to sleep.

1458
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:26,207
Be courteous! Be respectful!
Be alert!

1459
02:09:26,875 --> 02:09:32,040
On the 1 7th, that is two days later,
the wedding will take place!

1460
02:09:52,208 --> 02:09:57,415
Oh! l am floored!
- Where are you taking me?

1461
02:10:27,416 --> 02:10:31,082
Did you tell her?
- No. l don't know why!

1462
02:10:32,416 --> 02:10:34,749
l don't know; l could
easily have told mummy.

1463
02:10:35,041 --> 02:10:37,207
To papa also.
l had got a chance also.

1464
02:10:39,333 --> 02:10:42,499
l was feeling a strange kind
of fear! Restlessness!

1465
02:10:43,041 --> 02:10:46,665
As if something is wrong!
As if a train is leaving!

1466
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,415
Come here, come here.
Come here.

1467
02:10:51,041 --> 02:10:52,665
Show me.
- What happened?

1468
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:54,874
What is this?

1469
02:10:57,416 --> 02:11:00,499
What?
- Here, like this.

1470
02:11:02,041 --> 02:11:05,290
This tension doesn't suit your face.

1471
02:11:05,916 --> 02:11:11,415
You look very ugly. Your face like this!
You see?

1472
02:11:14,500 --> 02:11:18,790
Correct! - You look stunning this way.
Always be like this.

1473
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,874
lf you look good, then good things
will happen with you, ok?

1474
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:25,874
You have become just like me!

1475
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,790
'Geet!'- Listen!

1476
02:11:32,791 --> 02:11:35,999
Talk to Anshuman. He
is a bit distressed.

1477
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:39,207
'l am coming in!'
What is going on in here?

1478
02:11:40,875 --> 02:11:42,665
One minute. Let me talk to him.
- Sorry.

1479
02:11:44,125 --> 02:11:47,040
Hasn't grandma said that you will
not get together at night..

1480
02:11:47,083 --> 02:11:49,040
before the wedding?

1481
02:11:49,416 --> 02:11:51,415
Somebody has given a very
appropriate name to all of you.

1482
02:11:51,875 --> 02:11:52,790
'Saali!

1483
02:11:53,125 --> 02:11:54,999
Brother-in-law, you
have broken my heart.

1484
02:11:55,208 --> 02:11:58,207
You have invited my wrath
for the rest of your life. Come.

1485
02:12:00,208 --> 02:12:05,415
He too is here! Geet,
in front of him!- Shut up!

1486
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,957
We will talk tomorrow morning.
- Oh, cheating! Cheating!

1487
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:12,790
Bye-bye, brother-in-law!
Have a good night! With your friend!

1488
02:12:13,333 --> 02:12:15,874
Good night. - Bye, brother-in-law!
What happened?

1489
02:12:17,166 --> 02:12:18,415
Geet had come to meet you.

1490
02:12:18,666 --> 02:12:19,957
She said she will meet you
in the morning.

1491
02:12:20,333 --> 02:12:27,665
What? - ln front of him? Hey great.

1492
02:13:13,791 --> 02:13:14,749

1493
02:13:22,500 --> 02:13:23,665
Hi!
- Hi!

1494
02:13:23,875 --> 02:13:25,040
Did you get ready in the morning?

1495
02:13:25,333 --> 02:13:26,874
l will be leaving in a little while.

1496
02:13:28,291 --> 02:13:31,499
Are you leaving?
- l have to go.

1497
02:13:33,583 --> 02:13:35,082
These people will not let you go.

1498
02:13:37,583 --> 02:13:43,415
Geet, this time l will not stay back.
He is waiting for you. Bye.

1499
02:13:47,791 --> 02:13:52,665
Geet!

1500
02:14:04,333 --> 02:14:07,665
Ok, Geet. No tension, no problem.

1501
02:14:08,083 --> 02:14:10,499
You haven't told them
so far, no problem.

1502
02:14:11,125 --> 02:14:13,582
We will tell now.
l will tell you how.

1503
02:14:13,875 --> 02:14:16,999
Look, catch hold of one of them
whoever you come across first.

1504
02:14:17,208 --> 02:14:18,665
Mummy, papa or uncle.

1505
02:14:19,208 --> 02:14:22,207
And tell them that you are
ready to get married.

1506
02:14:22,500 --> 02:14:24,499
To Anshuman, and not to Aditya.

1507
02:14:25,083 --> 02:14:29,207
The schedule will remain the same.
The arrangements will remain the same.

1508
02:14:29,416 --> 02:14:31,874
Everybody will feel as happy
as they were supposed to be.

1509
02:14:32,416 --> 02:14:35,499
Just remove Aditya and
bring in Anshuman.

1510
02:14:36,166 --> 02:14:39,207
As soon as you say this, they
will ask you many questions.

1511
02:14:39,416 --> 02:14:44,415
This, and that and how!
Then you answer them.. about how we had met.

1512
02:14:44,625 --> 02:14:49,207
How l had come to meet you at your
hostel along with my friend!

1513
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,415
Then how we..

1514
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:55,874
'l was feeling a strange
kind of fear. '

1515
02:15:56,333 --> 02:15:57,665
'Restlessness. '

1516
02:15:59,041 --> 02:16:00,499
'As if something wrong
was happening. '

1517
02:16:01,791 --> 02:16:03,332
'As if some train was leaving. '

1518
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:26,665
Geet! Stop! Will you tell them now?

1519
02:16:27,416 --> 02:16:29,415
l will also tell them.
We will tell together.

1520
02:16:39,416 --> 02:16:43,999
Geet! Geet, stop!

1521
02:16:54,041 --> 02:16:54,540
Oh, gosh!

1522
02:16:57,416 --> 02:17:00,207

Grandpa! Grandpa!

1528
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:31,999
l will be under one
obligation from you.

1529
02:17:33,208 --> 02:17:36,665
Just one. That you brought
Anshuman back.

1530
02:17:37,083 --> 02:17:41,415
Otherwise l would never have
realised that.. what l wanted.

1531
02:17:43,166 --> 02:17:45,874
Aditya, now l am going
to listen to my heart.

1532
02:17:48,416 --> 02:17:50,082
Then everything will be all right.

1533
02:18:48,791 --> 02:18:51,415
