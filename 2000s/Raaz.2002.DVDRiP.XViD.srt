1
00:00:30,897 --> 00:00:36,199
My story travels far and wide across
these beautiful valleys of Ooty

2
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,761
Like roses, and thorns

3
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,707
Here it was that I became
someone's wife... and a woman

4
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:51,377
Love, devotion, faith
and sacrifice...

5
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,051
it was here that I got to know
what they really meant

6
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:58,822
Here it was that I practically
touched my life

7
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:05,796
At this place, I felt the cold
feeling of death, touch my body

8
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:11,432
There was a group of college students
on a picnic, that particular night

9
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:17,335
Little did I know that
what was happening then...

10
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,737
would also affect my life

11
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:31,219
You must do it.
The bottle stopped on you

12
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:33,321
That's the rule, isn't it guys?

13
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:41,823
Stop it!

14
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,113
Nisha, stop there!

15
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,519
Where are you going?

16
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,953
You might have to kiss
a lion or a tiger ahead!

17
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,100
Why're you bothering me?

18
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,897
I'm going to find you anyway!

19
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,609
Stop bothering me!

20
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,276
Where are you hiding?

21
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,211
She hasn't gone into that
bungalow, has she?

22
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:39,821
Nisha! That bungalow
doesn't belong to us!

23
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:42,952
Come on out

24
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:47,396
If you get caught, there's no saying
how many guys you'll have to kiss!

25
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,828
Listen to me!

26
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,831
Give me a kiss, please!

27
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,682
Rohit!

28
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,890
Who's there?

29
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,909
Who is it?

30
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:56,953
Raghu

31
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:58,623
Yes, sir?

32
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,195
Is someone here to meet me?

33
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,458
There's nobody, sir

34
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:26,984
Inspector?

35
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,519
Has there been a mishap
in the hills?

36
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,990
It's a strange incident

37
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:40,132
The police can't understand.
Only you can help us

38
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,519
He's the girl's boyfriend, sir

39
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,017
He has a broken bone
in his shoulder

40
00:06:03,963 --> 00:06:05,954
He can't believe...

41
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,024
how his girlfriend...

42
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,031
attacked him like a wild beast

43
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,263
Where's the girl?

44
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,770
The doctors aren't letting
anyone close to her

45
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,543
If you wish, you can take
a look at her from there

46
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,737
I've awakened! I'm awake!

47
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,669
I'm not going to spare him!

48
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,069
He'll have to come!

49
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,245
I'm awake! And he'll have to come!

50
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:02,087
They'll all awaken.
Like hell they will

51
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:05,082
I'm not going to spare him!
No way!

52
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,824
I've awakened...
I'm awake!

53
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,191
What are you staring at,
you swine?

54
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,091
You think you will stop me?
Me?

55
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,428
No!

56
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,897
I've awakened!

57
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,434
I'm awake!

58
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:30,105
I've already given her two injections.
They have no effect on her, sir

59
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:32,513
It won't have any effect!

60
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:37,114
What you think is a disease
of the brain...

61
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,025
is in fact a disease
chasing man for centuries

62
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,123
No matter what you do...

63
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,260
you can't cure this disease

64
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,925
Because you can treat
only human beings

65
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:50,700
Not erratic souls

66
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,800
And this is an erratic soul

67
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:57,132
But you are not going
to believe me

68
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:01,336
Because it does not suit
your profession to believe me

69
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,385
You weren't the one who was attacked.
It was the girl herself

70
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,885
We have very little time

71
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:16,319
Her body won't be able to tolerate
the spirit for very long. It'll explode

72
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,493
Do you want to save her?

73
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,962
Where did it happen?

74
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:24,792
Where?

75
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,629
I was standing there

76
00:08:28,974 --> 00:08:30,771
When I heard her cries...

77
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:33,941
I ran and came here

78
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,713
She was standing right there

79
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:40,808
Calm and quiet

80
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,144
What did you feel when
you got close to her?

81
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:48,154
I thought she was upto mischief
to bring me closer

82
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:50,489
What else?

83
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,693
Was there any other sign?

84
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,334
A gust of wind that could perhaps
have meant to tell you something?

85
00:08:58,303 --> 00:08:59,292
No

86
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:03,164
Didn't you feel as if you were
being drawn away by the hand...

87
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:05,900
and you had no control
over yourself?

88
00:09:06,144 --> 00:09:06,974
No

89
00:09:07,312 --> 00:09:10,304
Did you see someone else's face
in hers, when you got closer?

90
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:11,638
No

91
00:09:12,918 --> 00:09:15,853
Did you see terror in her eyes?

92
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:17,878
No

93
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,919
It all happened so quickly
that I felt...

94
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:29,457
Oh yes! The force with which
she pushed me, it felt as if...

95
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:33,202
It sure tells us that it wasn't
the doing of a human being

96
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:35,997
It was an evil spirit at work

97
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:44,444
Spirits draw strength from places
like this...

98
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:50,547
where an accident
might have taken place

99
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,226
At places where...

100
00:09:56,662 --> 00:10:00,564
where someone has sinned or where
something foul has taken place

101
00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:06,767
By coming here, you have
awakened a passive spirit

102
00:10:38,136 --> 00:10:40,263
Manoj here.
- Go on

103
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:47,905
She has left us

104
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,422
This is only the beginning

105
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:06,090
What does that mean?

106
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:10,293
Lts goal hasn't yet
been accomplished

107
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:14,298
If it's really a spirit...
can't we stop it?

108
00:11:16,808 --> 00:11:20,608
What transpired here?
Whose soul is it?

109
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:26,307
What does it want?
It's all a secret

110
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,651
A secret...

111
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,315
that lies buried somewhere here

112
00:11:36,094 --> 00:11:38,654
Unless we unravel the mystery...

113
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,325
it'll be difficult
to stop the spirit

114
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,666
Looks like lightning
will strike again

115
00:11:51,576 --> 00:11:58,140
On whom? And where?
Nobody knows

116
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,590
This is a city of peace

117
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,995
The air here
is unique

118
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:55,734
It's peaceful here

119
00:12:56,575 --> 00:13:00,067
Everything is at peace

120
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:04,640
Everything is at peace

121
00:13:48,693 --> 00:13:50,456
There's sunshine,
there's shade...

122
00:13:50,795 --> 00:13:52,592
there are moonlit nights

123
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:57,100
Beautiful girls throng the place

124
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:03,564
There are dreams,
there are celebrations...

125
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,638
and parties for the young

126
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:09,610
There's fun and frolic,
and merry-making everywhere

127
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:19,485
This is a city of peace

128
00:14:20,225 --> 00:14:23,820
The ambience here is unique

129
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:35,498
Everything is at peace

130
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:39,841
There's peace and quiet

131
00:15:20,118 --> 00:15:21,949
There are secrets...

132
00:15:22,287 --> 00:15:24,221
and there's love in hearts

133
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:26,353
There are friendships...

134
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,617
even foes are buddies

135
00:15:32,797 --> 00:15:34,662
There are desires,
there's comfort...

136
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:36,831
here you can reach
for the Moon

137
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:40,968
Summer and winter...
you have every season here

138
00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:50,573
This is a city of peace

139
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:55,309
The atmosphere here is unique

140
00:15:56,321 --> 00:15:59,188
This is a city of peace

141
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:03,254
The atmosphere here is unique

142
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:06,826
Everything here is at peace

143
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,359
Everything here is at peace

144
00:16:30,822 --> 00:16:32,414
What insolence is this?

145
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,758
You take me for a sidekick?

146
00:16:34,926 --> 00:16:37,019
It's you who's treating me
like a sidekick, Aditya

147
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:39,753
It doesn't seem as
if you've married me

148
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,293
It appears as if you've bought me!

149
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:45,831
For three hours, I've been
sitting all by myself...

150
00:16:46,204 --> 00:16:48,638
waiting for you to
cast a glance at me

151
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,038
But you can't find the time
from your merry-making

152
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:59,740
Don't you know this
is a business party?

153
00:17:00,985 --> 00:17:03,215
They've come in a delegation
from Hong Kong

154
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:07,982
Let me go in

155
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,323
Apart from listening to your crap,
I've also got to run my business

156
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:17,668
All right. Run your business,
whether your family lives or not

157
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:29,339
Everything here is at peace

158
00:17:30,148 --> 00:17:33,675
Everything is peaceful

159
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:36,207
I can't understand where
the girl went from the party

160
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,281
Why did she have to leave all alone?

161
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:45,015
Aditya... what is the matter?

162
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:58,425
Despite such an accident, she hasn't
as much as suffered a scratch

163
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,761
What's this, if not a miracle?

164
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:06,775
Ask her to be careful
in future

165
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:11,510
She shouldn't be driving after
having so many sleeping pills

166
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,278
It's like this, Mr Aditya...

167
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:18,055
she badly needs your care
right now

168
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:22,118
God has saved her

169
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:24,785
Or you had surely lost her today

170
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,816
Must you punish me like this?

171
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,415
What if something
had happened to you?

172
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:56,083
For how long will we keep
deceiving ourselves?

173
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:02,059
I'm sick of fighting all the time

174
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,236
It's time we separated, Aditya

175
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:12,834
Don't say that, Sanjana

176
00:20:20,318 --> 00:20:22,183
It's of no use

177
00:20:23,588 --> 00:20:25,647
You're not the same Aditya anymore

178
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,651
You're not the man
I fell in love with

179
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:34,856
In just a year,
you've changed so much

180
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,969
What's gotten into you?

181
00:20:41,973 --> 00:20:45,272
There's a chasm between us...
- I'll do away with the chasm

182
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:51,881
I need just one opportunity

183
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:55,881
Let's go someplace
far away from here

184
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:59,880
Someplace where only
you and I are there

185
00:21:04,629 --> 00:21:06,893
How about that delegation
from Hong Kong?

186
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:14,067
They can wait. But I don't
want to lose you again

187
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:17,898
Where would you like to go?

188
00:21:23,648 --> 00:21:25,707
I want to take you somewhere
far away...

189
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:29,578
where no voice calls out to us...
except we, to each other

190
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:30,910
Ooty

191
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:38,926
I want it to start there
all over again

192
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,257
That's where we first met

193
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:45,232
That's where we fell in love

194
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:40,314
I'll do the make up for you!

195
00:22:47,098 --> 00:22:49,089
Lay off!
- Where will you go?

196
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,995
Lay off, I say!
- I'm going to colour you!

197
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:57,503
No, Sanjana! No!

198
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,012
Hurry up!

199
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:11,818
How long will you make me wait?

200
00:23:52,263 --> 00:23:57,565
Even if you do come across me...

201
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:03,871
please do pull
a veil across your face

202
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:11,681
Our wedding isn't very far away...

203
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:17,851
I must pine.
You must long for me too

204
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:31,097
That's the problem
with my heart

205
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:37,106
You tell me how am
I to remain quiet

206
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:43,203
Even if I do come across you...

207
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:49,211
I ought to pull
a veil across my face

208
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:57,686
Our wedding isn't very far away...

209
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:03,897
I must pine.
You must pine too

210
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:16,871
That's the problem
with my heart

211
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:22,877
You tell me how I am
to remain quiet

212
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:03,887
These are the times when
I must pester you and flatter you

213
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:08,632
These are the times
I must try you out

214
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,868
I hope you get the message, my love

215
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:19,866
This is just what my problem is

216
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:23,874
I can no longer bear
the distance between us

217
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:28,743
How will I tell you what
I'm going through, my love

218
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,217
The earth and the skies
will bear witness...

219
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:39,563
you and I will come together

220
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:45,968
Even if I look into your eyes...

221
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:52,742
I wish you would
veil your face

222
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:25,833
If I were to leave this world,
and never return again...

223
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:31,741
what would you do, my love?

224
00:27:37,388 --> 00:27:39,879
From God, I would snatch you

225
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,953
I'll make you belong to me

226
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:48,698
Till as long as we live,
we shall never part

227
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:54,027
This promise,
we will never break...

228
00:27:54,505 --> 00:27:59,306
even if it angers God

229
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:06,014
Should I call you to meet me...

230
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:12,050
I hope you will veil your face

231
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:19,894
Our wedding isn't very far away

232
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:27,003
I must pine. So must you

233
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:34,067
My heart is the problem...

234
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:39,940
you tell me, how am I
to remain quiet?

235
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:53,361
What are you thinking about?
- Nothing

236
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:01,166
I'll go and change

237
00:31:40,631 --> 00:31:41,893
Who's that?

238
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:45,833
Who is it?

239
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:52,598
Who?

240
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:57,306
Who are you?

241
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:30,707
Who is it?

242
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:09,719
What's wrong with you?

243
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,483
There was so much of agony
in her cry

244
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,088
She's in deep trouble

245
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:24,928
We must help her, Aditya

246
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,497
We could help, if there
really was someone there

247
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:32,603
There's no one

248
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,608
I've heard her screaming.
Not once, but many times over

249
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:38,707
You can go ahead and think
that I'm mad

250
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:43,276
For me, however, it's as true
as you standing here before me

251
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:46,622
If it's true, why didn't
I hear her voice?

252
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,483
Why didn't I realise
her suffering?

253
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:54,958
You've given up realising anyone's
suffering long ago, Aditya

254
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:06,409
Sanjana! This is the root of
all your problems

255
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:09,304
You neither sleep, nor keep awake
after taking these pills

256
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:12,980
You hear and talk any nonsense.
- I can't go to sleep without it

257
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:15,911
So don't go to sleep.
I'll stay up with you

258
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:20,790
We'll chat and I'll hold
your hand all night

259
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:34,662
When you should have been with me,
you kept running away from me

260
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:39,343
Times were when I had
so much to talk you about...

261
00:34:40,778 --> 00:34:42,769
and you always chose to keep quiet

262
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:46,673
I suffered everything in silence

263
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:50,350
I kept awake, while you slept

264
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:58,693
Had you steadied me then, I wouldn't
have had the need for these pills today

265
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:01,824
But I can't do without them anymore

266
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:04,695
I can't

267
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,186
Aditya? You?

268
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,126
Without even informing us,
the Managing Director...

269
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:36,297
of the Park chain of hotels
is here in person!

270
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:38,731
I can't believe it

271
00:35:39,236 --> 00:35:42,399
Do I take it as a stroke of good luck
or is this an inspection, Mr M.D.?

272
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,738
No M.D. A friend is here
to meet a friend

273
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:49,069
By the way, where is your husband?

274
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:53,046
Someone has cast an evil eye
on your love

275
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:59,022
Your love was a shining example
for everybody in Ooty...

276
00:36:00,758 --> 00:36:02,749
and you go through such problems?

277
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,533
She couldn't go to sleep
when you were away

278
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:16,337
And she now swallows sleeping pills
in your presence

279
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:19,367
I can't believe it

280
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:24,776
Sanjana's quite a wise girl.
You haven't?

281
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:29,441
You could say I'm the one
who's not wise enough

282
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:33,518
I'm the one to blame
for whatever has happened

283
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:36,892
But I want to make my love an
example for others all over again

284
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:40,787
For this, I need help
from the two of you

285
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:43,528
Just don't worry

286
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:48,337
The two of us got you married.
We even gave the bride away

287
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:55,810
It's our problem now. Just see how
we solve it between the two of us

288
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:58,243
Where is she at the moment?

289
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:18,944
Madam...

290
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:25,228
Who are you?

291
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:27,954
I was told at the hotel that
the two of you have arrived

292
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:30,957
I was asked to clean the place

293
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:38,703
Why hasn't Robert come? We've been
waiting for him since last evening

294
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:42,636
Where has he gone?
- Even his wife doesn't know

295
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,972
He's been missing for eight months.
- Eight months?

296
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:49,411
Yes, Madam. Even the police
couldn't find him

297
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:52,717
No one knows what's happened of him
or where he has gone

298
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:55,448
His wife is in trouble, Madam

299
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,522
Do you know where she lives?

300
00:39:59,963 --> 00:40:01,954
He had started changing

301
00:40:02,966 --> 00:40:05,560
He did very strange things

302
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:10,967
He used to slog like an animal
in that bungalow

303
00:40:11,975 --> 00:40:15,536
And suddenly, he had started dreading
the very mention of the bungalow

304
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:21,140
He'd make some excuse or the other
to send me to do the chores

305
00:40:24,154 --> 00:40:26,247
And one day, he just vanished

306
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:30,619
Why didn't you call and tell Aditya?
- I did, Madam

307
00:40:30,994 --> 00:40:33,792
I called him on his cell-phone
from the post office

308
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:41,094
I also told the master that
before Robert disappeared...

309
00:40:41,938 --> 00:40:43,997
he had started hearing
strange voices

310
00:40:45,108 --> 00:40:49,408
He used to shut his ears and
rant like a madman all day

311
00:40:51,014 --> 00:40:53,608
He used to wake me up in the
middle of the night and say...

312
00:40:54,017 --> 00:40:57,680
that unless I went out
and stopped the voices...

313
00:40:58,021 --> 00:40:59,818
he'd walk out on me

314
00:41:01,324 --> 00:41:05,420
But I could have stopped the voices
only if I heard any

315
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:09,089
Only Robert could hear them

316
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,462
What sort of voice was it?

317
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:15,838
Of someone crying out in pain

318
00:41:26,216 --> 00:41:28,776
The fire rages on both sides

319
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:33,586
Bodies longing to be
consumed by the fires!

320
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:39,392
There you are...

321
00:41:40,063 --> 00:41:42,861
The fish escapes,
the shoe gets caught...

322
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,862
this is how, very often,
lovers go awry

323
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:48,302
Thank you

324
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,410
On an evening...

325
00:41:59,082 --> 00:42:00,413
amidst rainfall...

326
00:42:02,085 --> 00:42:03,746
and a romantic setting...

327
00:42:05,555 --> 00:42:08,251
let the song of love
be heard

328
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,586
There's fire

329
00:42:13,163 --> 00:42:14,425
There's longing

330
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:17,664
And a sense of failing balance

331
00:42:19,603 --> 00:42:22,572
Let me tell my lover
something today

332
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:56,934
All those promises we made...

333
00:42:57,874 --> 00:43:01,640
all those oaths we took together...

334
00:43:02,145 --> 00:43:08,311
you are the one who
brought dawn into my life

335
00:43:10,053 --> 00:43:12,749
Do you recollect?

336
00:43:14,524 --> 00:43:17,891
Do you remember?

337
00:43:24,734 --> 00:43:28,170
Beautiful days we spent...

338
00:43:28,705 --> 00:43:32,698
and our nights were lovely too

339
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:39,546
You are the one who
brought dawn into my life

340
00:43:40,917 --> 00:43:43,943
Do you remember?

341
00:43:45,288 --> 00:43:48,985
Do you remember?

342
00:44:26,896 --> 00:44:28,761
We stayed awake all nights

343
00:44:29,032 --> 00:44:30,966
We were lost in each other

344
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:34,793
We spoke about our love
for each other

345
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:39,968
Out of loneliness...

346
00:44:40,343 --> 00:44:43,642
we met each other every day

347
00:44:44,714 --> 00:44:52,314
In your arms, I found solace
and spent precious moments of my life

348
00:44:53,256 --> 00:44:57,590
Your beautiful moon-like face...

349
00:44:57,994 --> 00:45:01,259
I etched on my heart

350
00:45:02,265 --> 00:45:05,996
We were so close...

351
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:10,439
I happened to be your destiny

352
00:45:11,207 --> 00:45:17,271
On my lips was your name
all the time...

353
00:45:18,581 --> 00:45:21,573
do you remember?

354
00:45:23,286 --> 00:45:25,982
Yes, I do remember

355
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:31,022
I do remember

356
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:10,923
In daylight, in my dreams...

357
00:46:11,334 --> 00:46:14,929
you were the one
always in my sight

358
00:46:15,338 --> 00:46:20,002
You are my life,
you are what my story is all about...

359
00:46:20,343 --> 00:46:23,938
you are my destiny

360
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:28,874
I loved you and
took you for my own

361
00:46:29,152 --> 00:46:32,679
You gave me a place
in your heart

362
00:46:33,356 --> 00:46:41,354
With love, you lent colour
to my dreams

363
00:46:42,365 --> 00:46:46,028
Your lips I kissed...

364
00:46:46,469 --> 00:46:50,496
in your arms, I swayed...

365
00:46:51,107 --> 00:46:57,535
in your eyes, I dwelt

366
00:46:58,548 --> 00:47:02,382
Do you remember?

367
00:47:03,219 --> 00:47:06,620
Yes, I do remember

368
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:10,587
I sure do remember

369
00:47:13,396 --> 00:47:16,991
All those promises we made...

370
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:21,801
All those oaths
we took together

371
00:47:22,272 --> 00:47:28,404
You were the only who
brought dawn into my life

372
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:32,738
Do you remember?

373
00:47:34,417 --> 00:47:37,409
Yes, I remember

374
00:47:38,521 --> 00:47:42,218
Yes, I remember

375
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:40,478
Did you hear the gunshot?

376
00:48:43,219 --> 00:48:47,952
Sanjana, it wasn't a gunshot.
It was the door

377
00:48:49,225 --> 00:48:52,160
No, Aditya. I heard a gunshot

378
00:48:53,496 --> 00:48:58,490
It wasn't a gunshot, Sanjana.
It was the door

379
00:49:10,446 --> 00:49:12,380
Why didn't you tell me about Robert?

380
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,311
He used to hear
these noises too

381
00:49:19,789 --> 00:49:22,019
His wife telephoned you
to tell you about it

382
00:49:22,525 --> 00:49:24,322
So why did you hide it from me?

383
00:49:25,528 --> 00:49:28,190
I have so many servants, Sanjana

384
00:49:29,432 --> 00:49:31,798
Someone goes crazy,
someone disappears...

385
00:49:32,535 --> 00:49:37,336
and someone hears strange noises.
I can't keep track of everyone, can I?

386
00:50:00,096 --> 00:50:01,563
I'm tired

387
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:44,293
This woman has been wailing away!

388
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:49,035
You heard her. Didn't you, Madam?
Only you and I can listen to it

389
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:54,036
Nobody else can hear it...
not my wife, not my master

390
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:57,437
I'm fed up, Madam...
I'm fed up!

391
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:02,274
My brains are going to explode...
these noises will blow my mind

392
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:05,450
Save me, Madam. Please save me

393
00:52:05,788 --> 00:52:09,451
Or I'll go mad, Madam

394
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:11,919
I'll go mad!

395
00:52:25,808 --> 00:52:30,404
The noises I hear,
the things I feel...

396
00:52:30,813 --> 00:52:32,838
why doesn't Aditya feel them too?

397
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:39,746
I want to save my marriage.
At any cost

398
00:52:40,556 --> 00:52:43,354
I brought Aditya here
from Mumbai...

399
00:52:43,693 --> 00:52:47,493
to save our marriage
from falling apart

400
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:53,026
But having come here, I feel
as if the rift between us...

401
00:52:53,369 --> 00:52:56,827
has widened, instead
of making up

402
00:52:59,876 --> 00:53:03,869
Sanjana, whether someone
believes you or not...

403
00:53:04,847 --> 00:53:06,940
I know you're speaking the truth

404
00:53:07,917 --> 00:53:09,908
Have you heard of Vastu Shastra?

405
00:53:11,921 --> 00:53:14,185
At times, when your house isn't
properly planned...

406
00:53:15,224 --> 00:53:17,215
you begin to get strange ideas

407
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:21,224
Maybe this is responsible for
whatever you're going through

408
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:24,529
Whether someone believes
it or not...

409
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:27,066
I have faith in the
science of Vastu

410
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:31,400
I think we must consult
Professor Agni Swaroop

411
00:53:34,744 --> 00:53:38,305
Yes. He has great insight

412
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:41,740
And he can set right what is wrong

413
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:57,622
Is everything all right?

414
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,952
I'd like to believe
that everything is all right

415
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:09,965
But my body says there
is something here...

416
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:16,835
which is not right.
And the body never lies

417
00:55:17,713 --> 00:55:20,841
You might find my question strange

418
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:24,577
But you must think before
you answer me

419
00:55:28,057 --> 00:55:29,183
Go ahead

420
00:55:29,859 --> 00:55:32,191
Do you believe in ghosts?

421
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:36,855
In spirits? Good and evil?

422
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:40,062
Spirits that help and
spirits that torment?

423
00:55:41,003 --> 00:55:44,200
Spirits that long to accomplish
what has remained unfinished

424
00:55:45,741 --> 00:55:48,369
Have you ever heard
of tormented souls?

425
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:49,867
What?

426
00:55:58,554 --> 00:56:02,217
Has the breeze ever tried to whisper
something into your ears?

427
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:08,693
You don't find things suddenly
disappearing from your sight...

428
00:56:09,031 --> 00:56:10,896
and coming back again?

429
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:19,033
Strange voices, I mean

430
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:22,468
A stunning cry

431
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:26,643
Feeling of a presence,
despite being all alone

432
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:33,082
Do you feel as if you're wide awake
and yet, you're seeing a nightmare?

433
00:56:35,791 --> 00:56:38,521
Yes... how did you get to know?

434
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:43,064
Which means, there is someone

435
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:47,266
There is someone...

436
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:53,940
who wants to assert himself,
despite being dead

437
00:57:04,954 --> 00:57:06,615
What's up there?

438
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:20,659
How many days since you
opened this door?

439
00:57:21,103 --> 00:57:22,968
It's almost two years

440
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:44,993
But it feels as if someone has
been frequenting this place

441
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:15,316
If the lemon does not change
its colour till sunset...

442
00:58:17,693 --> 00:58:19,684
you can assume that everything
is all right

443
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:24,158
Or else...
- Or else?

444
00:58:26,769 --> 00:58:28,828
Or else, you could
face grave problems

445
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:34,769
Pray that the lemon does not
turn red by this evening

446
01:00:05,267 --> 01:00:07,929
I told you! There is someone!

447
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,803
There is something in our house!

448
01:00:12,141 --> 01:00:13,802
Those gunshots...

449
01:00:14,877 --> 01:00:19,905
There is someone in our house, Aditya!
There's a spirit haunting our house!

450
01:00:21,383 --> 01:00:25,149
Else, Professor Agni Swaroop's lemon
would not have turned red!

451
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:27,617
It wouldn't have turned red!

452
01:00:28,924 --> 01:00:30,949
I'm not lying, Aditya!

453
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:35,362
Ask Priya, if you don't believe me

454
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:40,168
There's a spirit in our house

455
01:00:40,836 --> 01:00:42,565
I have felt its presence

456
01:00:45,107 --> 01:00:47,268
Who do you think you are?

457
01:00:48,177 --> 01:00:50,577
You're a professor? Are you?

458
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:55,844
You make money out of scaring women!
- Mind your tongue!

459
01:00:56,185 --> 01:00:58,085
There's a ghost in my house?
Is there?

460
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,514
I'll have your blood!

461
01:01:02,858 --> 01:01:05,292
I'll report you to the police if
you even look at my house again!

462
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:07,789
Call the police! Go ahead!

463
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:10,859
You don't know who I am!
I'm Aditya Dhanraj!

464
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,636
Call the cops!
- I've dealt with your kind!

465
01:01:22,244 --> 01:01:24,371
But why isn't he taking the phone?

466
01:01:25,914 --> 01:01:31,181
Actually, Adi and
Sanjana have gone out

467
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,286
Let him not take the call,
if he doesn't want to

468
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:38,990
I'm not fond of lecturing him
like a school kid

469
01:01:39,695 --> 01:01:44,189
lt'll be kind of him if he doesn't
ruin the respect I've built...

470
01:01:44,533 --> 01:01:48,367
over the years, in brawls
and scraps

471
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:50,203
Yes, Uncle

472
01:01:50,539 --> 01:01:53,838
Yes, my foot! Can't you
make him see reason?

473
01:01:54,209 --> 01:01:55,870
He's no ordinary man

474
01:01:56,211 --> 01:01:58,543
The press always keep nosing around
for such stories

475
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:00,872
They've splashed the news
on the front-page

476
01:02:01,216 --> 01:02:04,879
Anyway, I haven't called to
talk to him about his exploits

477
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:07,211
I've something important
to discuss with him

478
01:02:07,422 --> 01:02:10,220
Yes, Uncle. I'll tell him

479
01:02:14,229 --> 01:02:17,426
Adi, you've got to
reach Bombay tomorrow

480
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,562
Uncle says the delegation
from Hong Kong...

481
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,962
can stay for another day
at the most

482
01:02:23,438 --> 01:02:27,898
If you don't have a meeting with them,
not only will you lose millions...

483
01:02:28,243 --> 01:02:30,234
your relations with them
will be over too

484
01:02:33,448 --> 01:02:38,249
I'm glad it happened.
I was fed up of this place anyway

485
01:02:39,454 --> 01:02:41,445
We'll take the afternoon flight back

486
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:48,386
Priya, will you do
something for me?

487
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:51,761
Professor, at least hear me out

488
01:02:54,269 --> 01:02:56,134
Sanjana is terribly embarrassed

489
01:02:58,874 --> 01:03:01,342
Or why would she send me here
to ask for your forgiveness?

490
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:08,445
She herself doesn't know
what got into Aditya

491
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,947
She wanted to come here to
meet you, Professor

492
01:03:13,522 --> 01:03:15,683
But there was this call
from Bombay suddenly...

493
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,619
and she had to leave with Aditya

494
01:03:17,826 --> 01:03:19,293
She hasn't gone at all!

495
01:03:20,295 --> 01:03:20,954
Pardon me?

496
01:03:21,296 --> 01:03:24,094
Till that power accomplishes
what it wants to...

497
01:03:24,433 --> 01:03:29,302
forget Mumbai, it won't let
Sanjana even leave this city

498
01:03:31,106 --> 01:03:33,301
Her husband wants to
take her away, isn't it?

499
01:03:36,044 --> 01:03:37,102
So let him!

500
01:03:37,412 --> 01:03:40,040
Professor, they've already left

501
01:03:40,482 --> 01:03:41,710
They've left

502
01:03:44,486 --> 01:03:46,317
But they haven't reached there

503
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:48,479
The road is blocked, sir.

504
01:03:48,824 --> 01:03:50,655
It'll take 5 or 6 hours
for the traffic to clear

505
01:03:51,059 --> 01:03:54,119
D'you want some tea or coffee?
- 3 cups of tea

506
01:03:57,332 --> 01:04:00,028
There's a landslide ahead, sir.
The road's blocked for 5 or 6 hours

507
01:04:00,335 --> 01:04:02,326
D'you want me to look
for a lodge for you?

508
01:04:06,975 --> 01:04:09,808
If there are unseasonal rains
or a storm, or a fog...

509
01:04:10,145 --> 01:04:13,672
descending in summer, what can
you or I do against an act of God?

510
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:16,746
You're being funny!
It's a contract worth millions

511
01:04:17,085 --> 01:04:19,849
If I don't get to Mumbai by tomorrow
morning, I'll have lost everything

512
01:04:22,057 --> 01:04:25,151
You can't get a flight from Ooty.
You'll have to drive to Coimbatore

513
01:04:25,494 --> 01:04:27,758
But there has to be a way.
Some way

514
01:04:29,097 --> 01:04:31,361
No, nothing can be
done about it today

515
01:04:32,067 --> 01:04:34,058
Even if we were to have a chopper
flown in from Bangalore...

516
01:04:34,369 --> 01:04:36,701
it'd take us a day to get
clearance from the army

517
01:04:37,172 --> 01:04:39,163
So call your father.
He'll handle everything

518
01:04:39,374 --> 01:04:41,365
No way. I don't want to
listen to his sermons again

519
01:04:43,378 --> 01:04:47,178
Suppose I take a flight from Bangalore,
instead of Coimbatore?

520
01:04:49,551 --> 01:04:51,644
I must take the flight from
Bangalore tomorrow morning

521
01:04:51,987 --> 01:04:53,978
For that, I'll have to drive
all night through Madhu Malai...

522
01:04:54,122 --> 01:04:56,181
to reach Bangalore at
six tomorrow morning

523
01:04:56,458 --> 01:04:59,723
It isn't a safe road. And you...
- Go ahead, Aditya

524
01:05:00,562 --> 01:05:02,553
I'll wait here for you

525
01:05:12,407 --> 01:05:14,739
As soon as my work is over,
I'll rush here

526
01:05:18,647 --> 01:05:21,411
And don't you dare take those
sleeping pills in my absence

527
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:24,618
I don't want you to see ghosts
all over again

528
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:29,980
The ghost's actually in the bottle.
Let it remain there

529
01:05:44,539 --> 01:05:47,099
Stop being stubborn
and pack your bags

530
01:05:47,609 --> 01:05:49,634
I can't leave you alone
in this house

531
01:05:50,045 --> 01:05:54,209
Please, Priya. Go away. I want to
stay here and find out the truth

532
01:05:54,549 --> 01:05:56,779
What truth are you talking about?

533
01:05:57,185 --> 01:06:03,055
Professor Agni has told you
that there's a spirit here

534
01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:06,450
You have yourself seen
the lemon change colors

535
01:06:06,928 --> 01:06:09,226
And even if what
he says is not true...

536
01:06:09,631 --> 01:06:11,599
where's the need for you
to take the risk?

537
01:06:11,766 --> 01:06:13,131
There is a need

538
01:06:14,469 --> 01:06:18,132
I want to find out whether a spirit
is indeed trying to talk to me...

539
01:06:18,473 --> 01:06:20,270
or is it a streak of madness

540
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:24,334
I want to know whether what I have
felt through the days and nights...

541
01:06:24,679 --> 01:06:28,206
is true, or is it an effect
of the sleeping pills I consume

542
01:06:29,217 --> 01:06:32,084
I want to find out whether what
Professor Agni says is true...

543
01:06:32,487 --> 01:06:36,480
or is Aditya? It's necessary
for me to have the answers

544
01:06:37,225 --> 01:06:38,317
Very necessary

545
01:10:28,223 --> 01:10:29,520
Who are you?

546
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:34,223
It's my house!

547
01:10:35,196 --> 01:10:38,723
So long as I live, I will not
let you take over my house!

548
01:10:39,467 --> 01:10:43,369
If you think you can drive me
away by scaring me...

549
01:10:43,738 --> 01:10:45,330
it's just not happening!

550
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:47,901
I'm not going to be scared!

551
01:10:48,743 --> 01:10:52,042
Till such time as I live,
you can't snatch my house from me!

552
01:10:54,616 --> 01:10:56,880
You're going to leave this place.
Not I!

553
01:12:56,338 --> 01:12:57,327
Go away!

554
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:02,841
Tell your friend that
I don't want any trouble

555
01:13:03,011 --> 01:13:05,912
I'm a simple man.
Let me get on with my life

556
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:08,574
I don't want to meddle in
anybody's family affairs

557
01:13:09,384 --> 01:13:13,286
But, Professor, you must...
- Not another word from you! Shut up!

558
01:13:13,855 --> 01:13:16,153
You think I will help you again?

559
01:13:16,858 --> 01:13:19,088
So her husband will get
physical with me again?

560
01:13:19,861 --> 01:13:21,692
This time, I will raise my hand too

561
01:13:22,864 --> 01:13:23,853
No

562
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:25,860
Get out!

563
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:29,670
I've seen her for myself, Professor

564
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:38,669
I've seen its face.
It's a woman

565
01:13:45,687 --> 01:13:47,621
What's all this about, Professor?

566
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:50,424
Earlier, she only
got hear the voices

567
01:13:50,892 --> 01:13:53,224
And now she's seeing things!
What's happening?

568
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:09,076
You're not connected with
that incident, are you?

569
01:14:09,911 --> 01:14:11,071
Which incident?

570
01:14:16,918 --> 01:14:19,250
This incident took place
in the forests behind your house

571
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:25,491
Exactly where you
heard the gunshot

572
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:33,124
It happened on May 16

573
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:37,934
On the same night, you met
with an accident too

574
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:41,666
About two hours
after this tragedy

575
01:14:43,111 --> 01:14:46,603
On recovering, you insisted that
you come to Ooty with your husband

576
01:14:48,183 --> 01:14:52,051
Whereas, your husband was willing to
take you to any part of the world

577
01:14:53,455 --> 01:14:55,116
What does that mean?

578
01:14:56,024 --> 01:14:58,959
The spirit in your house and
the spirit which killed Nisha...

579
01:14:59,294 --> 01:15:02,957
are one and the same.
- Which means, she's after me?

580
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:06,359
I don't know

581
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:16,136
I don't know whether
she wants to harm you

582
01:15:19,915 --> 01:15:21,473
But one thing is for sure

583
01:15:22,984 --> 01:15:24,975
She wants to say something to you

584
01:15:26,988 --> 01:15:29,980
She wants to tell you something.
- What?

585
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:34,992
We can decide that only when
we get to the spot

586
01:15:55,684 --> 01:15:56,673
Over there

587
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:01,011
The boy took me there

588
01:16:03,291 --> 01:16:05,816
You've got to go there.
On your own

589
01:16:11,266 --> 01:16:15,532
If you think I'm scared
to go there myself...

590
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:19,173
you are not entirely wrong

591
01:16:24,045 --> 01:16:25,569
But believe me...

592
01:16:27,115 --> 01:16:30,312
that isn't the only reason why
I'm sending you there on your own

593
01:16:30,685 --> 01:16:32,209
What else is it?

594
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:40,555
Whoever it is...

595
01:16:42,063 --> 01:16:43,860
she wants to talk to her

596
01:16:46,067 --> 01:16:48,365
There is something she wants
to tell only Sanjana

597
01:16:51,139 --> 01:16:53,073
If she wants to meet her...

598
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:57,201
she'll have to go all alone

599
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:02,148
We'll stay here. In the car

600
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:06,413
We're not staying here.
We're going with her

601
01:17:06,855 --> 01:17:11,690
Priya, I'll go there.
On my own

602
01:17:14,329 --> 01:17:16,320
Sanjana, you're...
- Please, Priya

603
01:18:30,906 --> 01:18:32,669
What do you want?

604
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:37,572
What are you getting at?

605
01:18:44,185 --> 01:18:46,176
You wanted me to come here

606
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:50,680
And here I am

607
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,197
Now tell me

608
01:19:06,274 --> 01:19:07,263
Speak

609
01:19:57,258 --> 01:19:58,657
Professor, I think...

610
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:27,097
You're right. That gun
was bought from this shop

611
01:22:28,577 --> 01:22:30,636
On the 2nd of September, 1988

612
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:33,710
After that, till March 2000...

613
01:22:34,049 --> 01:22:36,381
it was brought here for
servicing, every six months

614
01:22:37,085 --> 01:22:39,519
For a year and half now,
this gun wasn't sent here

615
01:22:39,821 --> 01:22:42,813
Whose gun is it?
Who holds the licence?

616
01:22:43,158 --> 01:22:45,456
It's a retired army colonel

617
01:22:46,394 --> 01:22:48,555
He had bought the gun
for his personal use

618
01:22:48,897 --> 01:22:51,923
What's the colonel's name?
- Colonel Arjun Malik

619
01:22:54,402 --> 01:22:55,391
The address?

620
01:23:03,411 --> 01:23:04,400
Yes?

621
01:23:06,114 --> 01:23:07,411
One moment, Madam

622
01:23:21,429 --> 01:23:22,953
Sir, there's a call for you

623
01:23:33,808 --> 01:23:37,767
I've found the gun
you used to kill an innocent

624
01:23:38,146 --> 01:23:39,613
What rubbish are you talking?

625
01:23:39,881 --> 01:23:42,782
Colt 8mm, Serial FB66

626
01:23:43,118 --> 01:23:45,109
That's the number of
your gun, isn't it?

627
01:23:48,223 --> 01:23:51,454
I don't have the time
to listen to your nonsense

628
01:23:53,461 --> 01:23:54,792
Don't hang up on me!

629
01:23:57,632 --> 01:24:01,466
What you have done has made life
miserable for me and my husband

630
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:05,631
My life is plunged in turmoil for
the disgusting things you've done!

631
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:09,067
To overcome my problems,
I'll have to meet you

632
01:24:11,212 --> 01:24:14,704
What if I choose not to meet you?

633
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:18,147
In which case, I'll hand
the gun to the police

634
01:24:18,486 --> 01:24:21,478
The police will find out
whom you killed and why

635
01:24:25,293 --> 01:24:28,592
All right.
Tomorrow at eleven

636
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:39,165
Where did you find the gun?
And in what circumstances?

637
01:24:39,507 --> 01:24:41,975
Why did you kill the girl?
And under what circumstances?

638
01:24:42,343 --> 01:24:44,971
Don't talk like a moron!
Why would I kill her?

639
01:24:45,346 --> 01:24:48,179
Because this just what
people like you always do

640
01:24:48,516 --> 01:24:52,008
You trap innocent girls, make
them victims of your lust...

641
01:24:52,353 --> 01:24:55,880
and once you've had enough of them,
you silence them with the gun...

642
01:24:56,224 --> 01:25:01,321
so that you can keep your
ugly face hidden behind a mask!

643
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:07,534
No father on earth can do to his
daughter, what you say I've done!

644
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:24,177
She was my daughter

645
01:25:25,553 --> 01:25:29,717
But as my daughter,
she gave me no comfort

646
01:25:30,425 --> 01:25:32,086
She was mentally ill

647
01:25:34,562 --> 01:25:36,894
I had her admitted to
the asylum several times

648
01:25:38,566 --> 01:25:40,830
But she would always escape

649
01:25:42,303 --> 01:25:44,567
She once locked me up
in my own room...

650
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:47,774
and ran away. Forever

651
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:53,577
After she had left, I discovered
that my revolver was missing

652
01:25:54,582 --> 01:25:58,916
I lodged a complaint with the police,
I had ads published in the papers...

653
01:25:59,587 --> 01:26:01,384
I looked for her everywhere

654
01:26:07,796 --> 01:26:14,258
And my search came to end
when you telephoned me

655
01:26:17,906 --> 01:26:22,775
It was obvious that my daughter
would never come back to me

656
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:32,213
The Colonel's daughter goes missing,
she then dies...

657
01:26:32,687 --> 01:26:36,623
and her spirit then compels you
to come here from Mumbai

658
01:26:37,325 --> 01:26:40,317
She shows you the gun and
tells you her address

659
01:26:40,762 --> 01:26:42,821
What is more, you even
get to see her

660
01:26:44,732 --> 01:26:46,632
Why's she doing all this?

661
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:51,638
We have no way of finding out

662
01:26:51,973 --> 01:26:53,304
There is a way

663
01:26:54,342 --> 01:26:56,333
There's no need for you
to go to her anymore

664
01:26:57,679 --> 01:26:59,909
If you wish, she could come to you

665
01:27:01,115 --> 01:27:03,106
With the help of this book

666
01:27:04,652 --> 01:27:06,711
But you will be playing with death

667
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:16,991
To begin with, you must chant
the mantras in that book...

668
01:27:17,332 --> 01:27:19,459
and summon her when
you're all alone

669
01:27:21,669 --> 01:27:25,469
Another thing: Such spirits
are very stubborn

670
01:27:28,543 --> 01:27:30,670
She will come at your behest

671
01:27:33,147 --> 01:27:35,172
But she will leave
only when she wants to

672
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:37,680
What if she refuses to leave?

673
01:27:38,019 --> 01:27:43,685
In that case, Sanjana will meet
with the same fate as Nisha

674
01:27:47,295 --> 01:27:48,694
Think it over

675
01:27:50,498 --> 01:27:52,363
I've decided, Professor

676
01:27:53,701 --> 01:27:56,693
Her secret is somehow
connected with my secret

677
01:27:57,705 --> 01:28:01,368
I want to know why she's playing
these games with me

678
01:28:02,477 --> 01:28:06,573
What made her call me here
all the way from Mumbai?

679
01:28:06,981 --> 01:28:10,508
Till such time as I have the answer,
I will have no peace

680
01:28:10,852 --> 01:28:15,721
I want to meet her, look
into her eyes, and ask her

681
01:28:16,391 --> 01:28:18,723
Even if I have to lay down my life

682
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:23,726
There's a particular way of reading
this book. I'll explain it to you

683
01:31:16,604 --> 01:31:20,005
Feelings help me
to overcome distances

684
01:31:24,612 --> 01:31:26,512
Extend a hand...

685
01:31:26,847 --> 01:31:28,712
so I may touch you

686
01:31:29,083 --> 01:31:31,847
You've even started drinking now?

687
01:31:37,858 --> 01:31:41,487
Intoxication finds new heights
when you drink

688
01:31:43,597 --> 01:31:47,397
Tonight is a night of mischief

689
01:31:51,105 --> 01:31:54,040
Tonight, I won't be able
to sleep without you

690
01:32:04,885 --> 01:32:07,149
You had left me far away

691
01:32:09,890 --> 01:32:11,949
All alone. In despair

692
01:32:16,063 --> 01:32:18,395
You have made me pine so much

693
01:32:20,134 --> 01:32:25,003
But tonight isn't a night of pining.
We ought to shower love

694
01:32:27,908 --> 01:32:33,210
For ages, this dry parched earth
hasn't had a drop of water

695
01:32:34,148 --> 01:32:36,912
Tonight, however,
it will see a storm

696
01:32:43,157 --> 01:32:46,923
Don't say anything...
just listen to me

697
01:32:47,928 --> 01:32:49,919
Let the fires rage

698
01:32:50,931 --> 01:32:52,922
Let me be charred

699
01:32:53,934 --> 01:32:57,495
For very long, this spark
has been buried in the embers

700
01:33:00,941 --> 01:33:03,171
You're acting like a nervous child

701
01:33:04,178 --> 01:33:06,476
It's not the first time
we're doing it

702
01:33:09,950 --> 01:33:12,942
I won't let your wife know anything
even this time

703
01:33:29,970 --> 01:33:31,301
Who's dead?

704
01:33:36,677 --> 01:33:38,076
Who's dead?

705
01:33:41,548 --> 01:33:43,607
What have you been hiding from me?

706
01:33:49,990 --> 01:33:51,582
Who was she?

707
01:33:54,061 --> 01:33:56,586
Who was she, I say!

708
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:00,989
Who?

709
01:34:08,075 --> 01:34:12,307
The last time I came to Ooty,
it was raining very heavily

710
01:37:25,806 --> 01:37:30,209
What I didn't know was that the
storm would walk right up to my door

711
01:37:43,257 --> 01:37:45,191
I've lost my way

712
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:51,691
Will you please help me?

713
01:37:58,038 --> 01:37:59,369
Come on in

714
01:38:07,114 --> 01:38:09,048
It's cold outside

715
01:38:13,687 --> 01:38:15,382
You're drenched

716
01:38:16,123 --> 01:38:20,253
Sit by the fireplace, I'll
arrange some clothes for you

717
01:38:42,082 --> 01:38:44,880
This is all I could find.
You'll have to manage

718
01:38:47,087 --> 01:38:48,748
On a cold night...

719
01:38:49,089 --> 01:38:52,855
when I'm feeling mischievous and
carry the burden of sleepiness...

720
01:38:53,227 --> 01:38:56,754
I'd have gone away to my house,
if I were in my city

721
01:38:57,097 --> 01:38:58,086
Pardon me?

722
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:02,227
You're not going to ask me
to leave, are you?

723
01:39:04,238 --> 01:39:06,229
On a night like this,
I just don't feel like...

724
01:39:06,573 --> 01:39:08,564
leaving this fireplace
and going out

725
01:39:12,146 --> 01:39:15,673
There's a guest-room here.
You can rest there, if you wish

726
01:39:15,349 --> 01:39:17,943
Despite putting all the woes
in the world together...

727
01:39:20,287 --> 01:39:22,915
when nature still couldn't
achieve anything...

728
01:39:22,456 --> 01:39:25,186
it gave you those eyes

729
01:40:09,903 --> 01:40:13,896
There's so much of feeling
in your eyes

730
01:40:13,340 --> 01:40:18,141
I made this tune as an acknowledgement
of your loneliness

731
01:40:17,244 --> 01:40:20,680
Distances between hearts are
overcome with feelings

732
01:40:25,185 --> 01:40:26,982
Say nothing tonight

733
01:40:26,086 --> 01:40:30,455
Just savour your loneliness

734
01:40:31,191 --> 01:40:34,422
Heat and desires
burn out in failure

735
01:40:58,085 --> 01:41:01,145
Like the lamp,
I burn every night

736
01:41:03,223 --> 01:41:06,886
The lamp that burns
for everybody to see...

737
01:41:04,391 --> 01:41:07,258
is the flame that
consigns me to anonymity

738
01:41:05,359 --> 01:41:09,090
Whenever your name
appears with mine...

739
01:41:10,464 --> 01:41:14,696
I wonder why people
burn with envy - Malini

740
01:41:42,663 --> 01:41:45,598
If the Board of Directors' meeting
is not held tomorrow...

741
01:41:48,735 --> 01:41:49,724
One moment

742
01:41:51,271 --> 01:41:53,205
I'll call you later

743
01:41:52,439 --> 01:41:53,701
Don't stop

744
01:41:55,209 --> 01:41:59,873
Don't get so close to me.
I could destroy you

745
01:41:59,279 --> 01:42:01,213
And I want to be destroyed

746
01:42:01,014 --> 01:42:05,576
In love with you,
I have begun to blossom

747
01:42:03,417 --> 01:42:06,682
A look at you...

748
01:42:07,154 --> 01:42:09,145
and I have begun to flower

749
01:42:07,287 --> 01:42:13,055
Such is the manner in which
I've fallen in love with you...

750
01:42:11,458 --> 01:42:16,760
I'm going to pieces

751
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:19,121
In love with you,
I have begun to blossom

752
01:43:14,521 --> 01:43:19,322
Should you make me
suffer like this...

753
01:43:20,527 --> 01:43:25,328
my longing will drive me mad

754
01:43:26,466 --> 01:43:32,098
I've found the one
I've been looking for

755
01:43:32,539 --> 01:43:38,535
I was restless, I was thirsty
through many lifetimes

756
01:43:41,248 --> 01:43:46,709
From our bodies,
we're becoming one in soul

757
01:43:59,366 --> 01:44:04,861
Such is the manner in which
I've fallen in love with you...

758
01:44:05,572 --> 01:44:10,839
I've begun to go to pieces

759
01:44:11,578 --> 01:44:17,574
In love with you,
I have begun to blossom

760
01:45:12,773 --> 01:45:18,211
Our bodies will melt

761
01:45:18,779 --> 01:45:23,716
The fires will rage...
our hearts will go berserk

762
01:45:24,785 --> 01:45:27,447
Should my lips meet yours...

763
01:45:28,055 --> 01:45:33,459
sparks will emanate
even from the dew

764
01:45:39,666 --> 01:45:45,662
We're crossing all limits, my love

765
01:45:57,784 --> 01:46:03,245
Such is my love for you...

766
01:46:03,824 --> 01:46:09,421
I'm going to pieces

767
01:46:16,169 --> 01:46:21,698
In love with you,
I have begun to blossom

768
01:47:09,623 --> 01:47:11,284
What's wrong with you?

769
01:47:20,467 --> 01:47:22,059
It's not loaded

770
01:47:26,773 --> 01:47:28,434
Where did you get the gun from?

771
01:47:31,845 --> 01:47:38,444
I lead the life of a wanderer.
What I might need and when...

772
01:47:39,786 --> 01:47:42,949
and when I might need this...
who knows?

773
01:47:46,793 --> 01:47:48,852
Not every man is as decent...

774
01:47:49,596 --> 01:47:52,997
as good looking and
as honest as you are

775
01:48:06,813 --> 01:48:10,579
It takes time for the romance to go
out of the lives of married couples

776
01:48:12,953 --> 01:48:16,150
And you've stopped telephoning me
in just a year or two

777
01:48:23,630 --> 01:48:26,030
I swear, I was about
to give you a call

778
01:48:26,967 --> 01:48:28,628
I'm glad you called instead

779
01:48:29,369 --> 01:48:31,428
It's difficult to get through
from Ooty

780
01:48:36,009 --> 01:48:38,170
Are you alone, Aditya?

781
01:48:41,515 --> 01:48:42,573
What does that mean?

782
01:48:42,849 --> 01:48:44,840
Is someone else there with you?

783
01:48:50,657 --> 01:48:51,646
Yes, there is

784
01:48:52,025 --> 01:48:53,925
Who? Is it Ajay?

785
01:49:00,467 --> 01:49:02,458
Me. And my loneliness

786
01:49:05,872 --> 01:49:08,773
My cellphone is ringing.
I'll call you in a while

787
01:49:09,109 --> 01:49:10,667
No... I'll call you

788
01:49:24,057 --> 01:49:28,892
Thank you. Thank you for the honour

789
01:49:31,231 --> 01:49:32,892
You're an amazing man

790
01:49:34,568 --> 01:49:36,900
You can share my bed with me

791
01:49:37,604 --> 01:49:40,164
But you just wouldn't want
the world to know about it

792
01:49:40,907 --> 01:49:42,704
And the fool that I am...

793
01:49:43,710 --> 01:49:46,645
I thought you were different
from other men

794
01:49:47,647 --> 01:49:49,046
I was so wrong

795
01:49:49,649 --> 01:49:53,915
Aditya, why haven't you
told your wife about me?

796
01:49:56,022 --> 01:49:58,252
Why didn't you tell her that
you're with me right now?

797
01:50:00,660 --> 01:50:02,423
You're scared of her, aren't you?

798
01:50:04,664 --> 01:50:06,928
Aren't you? Right?

799
01:50:11,938 --> 01:50:17,069
Don't stand there like a dumb animal!
Answer my question, Aditya. Answer me!

800
01:50:18,812 --> 01:50:20,609
Coward! Chicken!

801
01:50:21,948 --> 01:50:23,142
Eunuch!

802
01:50:54,114 --> 01:50:56,480
I'm wiping out every trace
of that bitch...

803
01:50:56,950 --> 01:50:59,282
whom you don't forget
even in your dreams!

804
01:51:03,691 --> 01:51:07,422
You're with me only in body.
You soul's always with that bitch!

805
01:51:07,761 --> 01:51:11,697
Cut the melodrama, Malini!
- I'll drive her out of your life

806
01:51:12,032 --> 01:51:14,967
Out of your house, and your mind!

807
01:51:15,336 --> 01:51:18,032
If I still can't drive her away,
I'll burn that bitch alive!

808
01:51:52,072 --> 01:51:56,202
I beg you. Don't compel me
to do such things

809
01:51:59,012 --> 01:52:02,573
For the decency I had to let you
stay at this house...

810
01:52:03,016 --> 01:52:05,007
please leave in a decent manner

811
01:52:07,721 --> 01:52:12,590
I want to forget whatever
has happened between us

812
01:52:25,839 --> 01:52:28,364
I'm not a line written
in pencil...

813
01:52:28,776 --> 01:52:31,336
that you can erase
any time you wish to

814
01:52:32,146 --> 01:52:35,377
Listen to what I say very
carefully, Aditya Dhanraj

815
01:52:36,750 --> 01:52:41,050
I'm going to snatch you
from the bitch, come what may

816
01:52:45,859 --> 01:52:47,053
This is enough

817
01:52:48,128 --> 01:52:50,722
Leave me alone, Aditya!
Leave me alone!

818
01:52:51,064 --> 01:52:53,055
You can't do this to me, Aditya!

819
01:52:59,807 --> 01:53:02,799
Open the door, Aditya!

820
01:53:03,477 --> 01:53:06,344
You've thrown me out of the house
for the sake of that bitch!

821
01:53:06,847 --> 01:53:08,576
I wouldn't even spit at you!

822
01:53:11,084 --> 01:53:12,813
To hell with you, Aditya Dhanraj!

823
01:54:35,168 --> 01:54:37,295
Get out of my way, please

824
01:54:38,939 --> 01:54:42,431
I shouldn't have done such a thing.
Never

825
01:54:43,410 --> 01:54:45,503
Hit me, if you wish to...

826
01:54:45,846 --> 01:54:48,576
but please don't be angry with me

827
01:54:49,349 --> 01:54:52,409
For all the love you gave me,
what did I do to you?

828
01:54:53,887 --> 01:54:55,377
I'm so ashamed!

829
01:54:56,189 --> 01:54:57,588
But I can't help it, Aditya

830
01:54:57,925 --> 01:55:00,519
Whenever I imagine you with that
woman, it sets my blood boiling

831
01:55:01,194 --> 01:55:03,185
I wish you were not married to her

832
01:55:03,463 --> 01:55:07,593
I wish I could erase memories of
every moment you spent with her

833
01:55:07,935 --> 01:55:12,201
I wish she had never touched you.
I wish you belonged only to me...

834
01:55:14,775 --> 01:55:17,676
Sanjana is my wife. She has a right
to my body and my soul...

835
01:55:18,011 --> 01:55:20,536
notjust in this lifetime
but every time I'm born

836
01:55:22,583 --> 01:55:25,017
Hear me out, Aditya... please!

837
01:55:25,352 --> 01:55:28,844
Please don't leave me...
listen to me!

838
01:55:29,222 --> 01:55:32,214
Don't go away, Aditya

839
01:55:36,063 --> 01:55:38,793
Don't leave me, Aditya... please
- Get lost!

840
01:55:53,246 --> 01:55:54,679
What are you doing?

841
01:55:56,249 --> 01:55:57,841
What do you take me for?

842
01:55:58,719 --> 01:56:02,450
I'll wipe out every memory you have
for that woman in your heart!

843
01:56:03,991 --> 01:56:06,926
I won't let you show your back
to your love and run away!

844
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:10,195
I won't let anyone
snatch you from me!

845
01:56:10,530 --> 01:56:13,897
You belong only to me...
only to me!

846
01:56:19,973 --> 01:56:23,500
We'll have to provide better
facilities to our customers...

847
01:56:23,944 --> 01:56:28,278
we'll have to renovate the hotel;
we'll have to do the landscaping again

848
01:56:29,016 --> 01:56:31,644
And we'll have to change the
interiors of the entire hotel

849
01:56:32,019 --> 01:56:34,954
It's going to cost us
about 20 million rupees

850
01:56:36,289 --> 01:56:37,847
What do you think, Aditya?

851
01:56:44,297 --> 01:56:46,231
Should we take such a big risk?

852
01:56:49,636 --> 01:56:51,297
Do as you think fit

853
01:57:42,522 --> 01:57:44,353
How dare you come here again?

854
01:57:48,295 --> 01:57:50,855
Just one difference between me
and that bitch, isn't it?

855
01:57:52,099 --> 01:57:54,090
She wears this collar
around her neck, right?

856
01:57:58,605 --> 01:58:03,372
Tie it around my neck.
Tell her everything about me

857
01:58:04,377 --> 01:58:07,073
Tell her that I'm the one
you really love

858
01:58:07,414 --> 01:58:10,383
You're out of your mind.
Go away, else...

859
01:58:10,717 --> 01:58:12,582
I have very little time, Aditya

860
01:58:14,187 --> 01:58:15,984
The police have found my jeep

861
01:58:16,556 --> 01:58:18,547
My Papa will come here,
if he gets to know

862
01:58:19,126 --> 01:58:21,117
I don't want to go back
to the institution

863
01:58:21,394 --> 01:58:23,191
Put that gun away, Malini

864
01:58:23,530 --> 01:58:26,124
Make that telephone call quickly

865
01:58:26,633 --> 01:58:29,067
Tell her that we can't live
without each other

866
01:58:29,402 --> 01:58:31,393
Go on. Call her quickly

867
01:58:36,576 --> 01:58:40,410
Skip this madness. I'm not
doing anything of that sort

868
01:58:42,149 --> 01:58:45,414
Put that gun away.
- You're the one acting mad, Aditya

869
01:58:46,419 --> 01:58:49,911
You know very well that we can't
live without each other. Don't you?

870
01:58:51,124 --> 01:58:55,322
This lifetime and every time
we are born...

871
01:58:55,695 --> 01:58:58,755
you will belong only to me.
So tell her that

872
01:58:59,566 --> 01:59:02,228
You have accepted me
of your own volition

873
01:59:02,569 --> 01:59:07,438
Till she starts believing that
I'm the woman you really love...

874
01:59:08,441 --> 01:59:10,739
she's not going away
from our lives

875
01:59:11,545 --> 01:59:15,572
Go on now. Tell her...
make that call

876
01:59:18,451 --> 01:59:19,782
Make that call!

877
01:59:21,154 --> 01:59:23,452
Malini, I love my wife very much

878
01:59:24,457 --> 01:59:27,915
And I'm not going to tell her
about you and me. Never

879
01:59:28,461 --> 01:59:30,588
You mustn't make the mistake
of doing that either

880
01:59:31,198 --> 01:59:35,464
Because she loves me so much...
she won't ever believe you

881
01:59:36,236 --> 01:59:39,034
Not even if she finds
my corpse in this house?

882
01:59:39,439 --> 01:59:41,134
Put that gun away. Right now!

883
01:59:41,474 --> 01:59:43,465
She's bound to know, Aditya

884
01:59:44,511 --> 01:59:47,480
While I live, or after I die

885
02:00:00,493 --> 02:00:02,461
I had never imagined...

886
02:00:03,163 --> 02:00:07,862
that her madness and obsession
would go to such lengths

887
02:00:08,535 --> 02:00:13,199
That one gunshot blasted my power
of reasoning and my good sense

888
02:00:14,474 --> 02:00:19,070
It was only Robert I could
look to, for some loyalty

889
02:00:20,180 --> 02:00:24,139
With his help, I then did
what I thought was right

890
02:00:25,485 --> 02:00:28,977
We buried her body in the forest

891
02:00:29,723 --> 02:00:31,623
I had no choice

892
02:00:33,193 --> 02:00:35,184
How many people would believe
I was speaking the truth?

893
02:00:36,496 --> 02:00:41,490
The manner in which she was
living with me, a married man...

894
02:00:42,669 --> 02:00:46,901
would only suggest that she had
not committed suicide...

895
02:00:47,707 --> 02:00:49,504
that I had killed her

896
02:00:50,243 --> 02:00:53,644
What would I tell the police?
What would I tell Papa?

897
02:00:55,515 --> 02:00:56,846
And you...

898
02:00:57,684 --> 02:01:02,178
I didn't tell you about it
because I didn't want to lose you

899
02:01:03,523 --> 02:01:06,185
It was as if I wasn't
burying Malini's body...

900
02:01:06,526 --> 02:01:11,259
I was burying the fear of
being separated from you

901
02:01:18,304 --> 02:01:23,332
I can't imagine a life without you
Because...

902
02:01:29,282 --> 02:01:31,216
I love you very dearly, Sanjana

903
02:01:32,418 --> 02:01:35,546
I must compliment you on
your nerve, Aditya Dhanraj

904
02:01:37,557 --> 02:01:45,157
Behind my back, on my own bed,
you had a great time with a whore

905
02:01:45,965 --> 02:01:48,229
And yet, you claim to be
in love with me?

906
02:01:49,269 --> 02:01:54,901
After mercilessly crushing my love
in this very bed...

907
02:01:55,508 --> 02:02:00,969
you want me to forget everything
and accept you?

908
02:02:01,581 --> 02:02:03,572
And take you in my arms?

909
02:02:04,317 --> 02:02:06,581
I won't be able to carry out
the farce, Aditya

910
02:02:06,920 --> 02:02:12,688
I ask for your forgiveness, Sanjana.
Please... forgive me

911
02:02:13,726 --> 02:02:17,662
Forgive your husband, Sanjana.
- I find you repulsive

912
02:02:19,599 --> 02:02:24,263
I cried before you for so many days,
I suffered...

913
02:02:24,737 --> 02:02:28,605
and you kept spurning me,
instead of telling me the truth

914
02:02:29,676 --> 02:02:34,613
To keep our marriage alive,
I begged for your love

915
02:02:35,615 --> 02:02:37,742
And you kept rejecting me

916
02:02:39,619 --> 02:02:44,215
And now, when the shadows of
your past have begun to haunt me...

917
02:02:44,624 --> 02:02:46,956
when I've begun to
hear those screams...

918
02:02:48,294 --> 02:02:53,197
you try to prove that I was a liar.
Whereas you are the liar, Aditya

919
02:02:53,766 --> 02:02:58,635
And I can never forget a liar.
Never!

920
02:03:35,108 --> 02:03:39,977
You have a lovable face...

921
02:03:40,647 --> 02:03:44,674
I could die for it

922
02:03:45,718 --> 02:03:52,146
You do not know how much I love you

923
02:03:56,529 --> 02:04:01,193
You have a loveable face...

924
02:04:01,701 --> 02:04:05,694
I could die for you

925
02:04:31,030 --> 02:04:36,525
This journey of love
is a difficult one

926
02:04:41,774 --> 02:04:47,406
He who steadies himself
after falling...

927
02:04:47,847 --> 02:04:52,045
finds his goal

928
02:04:52,518 --> 02:04:58,320
No matter how difficult
our path is...

929
02:04:58,758 --> 02:05:02,751
we happily walk through it

930
02:05:13,906 --> 02:05:18,343
For your lovable face...

931
02:05:18,911 --> 02:05:23,780
I could even lay down
my life

932
02:05:28,454 --> 02:05:30,217
That's a good thing you did, Sanjana

933
02:05:30,790 --> 02:05:34,453
In your shoes, I'd have
done the same thing

934
02:05:35,461 --> 02:05:38,897
I couldn't imagine that Aditya was
capable of doing something so hideous

935
02:05:39,999 --> 02:05:41,591
You must never return to him

936
02:05:41,901 --> 02:05:44,597
Don't ever make that mistake, Sanjana

937
02:05:45,505 --> 02:05:51,808
That is just what that woman wants.
I can understand it all. Everything!

938
02:05:52,812 --> 02:05:54,803
Why did she draw you here
from Mumbai?

939
02:05:55,481 --> 02:05:57,608
Why did she always try
to talk to you?

940
02:05:58,317 --> 02:06:00,945
Why did she expose your
husband's secret to you?

941
02:06:01,821 --> 02:06:04,483
She wants you and Aditya
to hate each other...

942
02:06:04,824 --> 02:06:06,815
so that you will leave him forever

943
02:06:10,830 --> 02:06:13,424
What would she gain out of that?
- Aditya!

944
02:06:16,602 --> 02:06:18,536
Sanjana is devoted to her husband

945
02:06:18,838 --> 02:06:22,069
And a woman who is devoted to
her husband, acts as his shield

946
02:06:23,309 --> 02:06:26,039
Even God is afraid to meddle
with her husband's life

947
02:06:26,846 --> 02:06:28,837
But this is an evil spirit

948
02:06:30,850 --> 02:06:33,512
She was smart enough to
separate the two of you

949
02:06:35,021 --> 02:06:38,115
As for Aditya...
he's all alone now

950
02:06:39,859 --> 02:06:43,351
Are you telling us that Sanjana
must go back to Aditya?

951
02:06:43,763 --> 02:06:47,358
If not as his wife, as a human being
she must go back to Aditya

952
02:06:49,869 --> 02:06:52,269
Because she's the only one
who can save Aditya's life

953
02:06:52,872 --> 02:06:56,205
That woman will now try to take
Aditya away with her forever

954
02:06:57,577 --> 02:06:59,044
For that...

955
02:07:00,113 --> 02:07:03,139
she'll have to release Aditya
from his body

956
02:07:03,983 --> 02:07:05,883
She'll have to kill him

957
02:07:08,187 --> 02:07:11,554
I haven't come here to
save our relationship

958
02:07:11,891 --> 02:07:13,688
I'm here to save your life

959
02:07:14,026 --> 02:07:17,359
Once I have seen you off
at your door...

960
02:07:17,697 --> 02:07:19,892
I don't want to see your face again

961
02:07:23,436 --> 02:07:26,132
Get the master's luggage.
We're leaving for Mumbai right now

962
02:08:02,241 --> 02:08:03,936
Where's the master?

963
02:08:04,610 --> 02:08:06,874
What are you staring at me for?
Where's the master?

964
02:08:07,213 --> 02:08:09,010
I don't understand, Madam

965
02:08:10,516 --> 02:08:12,848
The master left with you
in a car, just moments ago

966
02:08:13,186 --> 02:08:15,279
What nonsense are you talking?
I've walked in here right now

967
02:08:29,101 --> 02:08:31,296
This is how the beginning
of the end always is

968
02:08:33,773 --> 02:08:36,503
That power is now close in
on its victim

969
02:08:39,979 --> 02:08:44,245
She's not going to spare
anyone now... no one!

970
02:08:52,325 --> 02:08:54,122
Listen to me, Sanjana. Please

971
02:08:59,699 --> 02:09:01,394
Look at me, please

972
02:09:51,017 --> 02:09:56,319
Should I leave the world
and never return again?

973
02:09:56,756 --> 02:10:01,989
What would you do, my love?

974
02:10:08,301 --> 02:10:13,329
I'd snatch you from God.
I'd make you belong to me

975
02:10:13,740 --> 02:10:19,007
Till as long as we live,
we shall never part

976
02:10:19,412 --> 02:10:24,008
May this pledge never break

977
02:10:25,251 --> 02:10:29,312
Even if it angers God

978
02:10:37,430 --> 02:10:39,159
The doctors are doing their best

979
02:10:39,365 --> 02:10:41,356
A couple of fractures in
the hip and his legs

980
02:10:41,701 --> 02:10:45,034
They say he'll be all right if he
regains consciousness in two hours

981
02:10:45,905 --> 02:10:47,600
Will he live, or won't he?

982
02:10:48,174 --> 02:10:50,369
Uncle's flying with
experts from Mumbai

983
02:10:51,044 --> 02:10:52,705
These people talk any nonsense

984
02:10:53,046 --> 02:10:55,037
They'll take over everything the
moment they arrive, you will see

985
02:10:55,381 --> 02:10:56,746
Will he live, or won't he?

986
02:10:57,050 --> 02:11:00,645
The car fell from a height of
just 50 feet. Straight down, too

987
02:11:01,721 --> 02:11:03,313
Will he survive, or won't he?

988
02:11:33,086 --> 02:11:35,077
There's just one way
of saving Aditya

989
02:11:36,089 --> 02:11:39,422
He's still breathing.
Before he stops breathing...

990
02:11:39,759 --> 02:11:42,660
let's burn Malini's body.
That could save him

991
02:11:43,096 --> 02:11:46,429
That's the only way that
wandering spirit can be dealt with

992
02:11:47,633 --> 02:11:49,294
After burning in the pyre...

993
02:11:49,635 --> 02:11:52,661
whether she wants it or not,
she has to accept a release

994
02:11:53,106 --> 02:11:57,202
Let's go and find her body
before she takes Aditya and...

995
02:11:57,610 --> 02:12:00,238
She won't be able to do
any harm to my Aditya

996
02:12:01,280 --> 02:12:03,908
Once, she snatched him from me

997
02:12:04,884 --> 02:12:07,444
I won't let her do it again

998
02:12:09,255 --> 02:12:11,120
No matter what she does...

999
02:12:11,824 --> 02:12:15,225
I will snatch my husband
from the jaws of death

1000
02:12:43,156 --> 02:12:46,683
Should this lemon turn red
where we place it...

1001
02:12:47,360 --> 02:12:51,490
it'll means she's right there.
That's where we must look for her

1002
02:12:52,265 --> 02:12:53,789
This is the place

1003
02:12:55,168 --> 02:12:57,159
She should be somewhere here

1004
02:15:03,963 --> 02:15:06,431
I think we must burn this body
right here

1005
02:17:55,735 --> 02:17:57,635
You're the faithful bitch, aren't you?

1006
02:17:59,672 --> 02:18:01,936
Despite knowing that Aditya
belongs to me...

1007
02:18:02,742 --> 02:18:05,905
you keep following him
with your tongue hanging out...

1008
02:18:06,246 --> 02:18:08,111
and even get here?

1009
02:18:08,448 --> 02:18:10,973
Shameless creature! Whore!

1010
02:18:11,451 --> 02:18:14,079
He has slept in my arms!

1011
02:18:15,255 --> 02:18:19,453
Before you can burn my corpse and
try to distance him from me...

1012
02:18:20,260 --> 02:18:22,251
I'll turn you into a corpse!

1013
02:24:57,622 --> 02:24:59,317
Congratulations, Mr Dhanraj

1014
02:24:59,691 --> 02:25:01,818
There's no danger
to your son's life

1015
02:25:38,596 --> 02:25:41,588
Sanjana, I was wrong...
absolutely wrong!

1016
02:25:44,803 --> 02:25:46,395
My friend has made it

1017
02:25:47,772 --> 02:25:49,433
Your Aditya has made it

1018
02:26:01,886 --> 02:26:05,617
There's just one reason why
Aditya is alive. It's Sanjana

1019
02:26:06,891 --> 02:26:11,988
Sanjana has proved that if a woman
is bent on saving her husband's life...

1020
02:26:12,363 --> 02:26:16,026
it can change the minds
of both... God and Satan

1021
02:26:52,537 --> 02:26:57,668
Every pain we will bear together

1022
02:26:58,076 --> 02:27:01,944
Let's resolve to do that

1023
02:27:03,281 --> 02:27:08,617
We shall never break...

1024
02:27:09,220 --> 02:27:13,179
let's promise each other

1025
02:27:13,958 --> 02:27:19,954
I'm afraid of the very idea
of going to seed

1026
02:27:35,246 --> 02:27:37,976
Yours is a lovable face...

1027
02:27:40,084 --> 02:27:43,986
I could die for it

1028
02:27:45,924 --> 02:27:48,518
You do not know...

1029
02:27:48,993 --> 02:27:52,451
how much I love you

1030
02:28:14,152 --> 02:28:16,017
To fall in love is easy

1031
02:28:16,721 --> 02:28:19,485
To live up to it
is very difficult

1032
02:28:20,959 --> 02:28:23,427
Only after I had passed
this test of love...

1033
02:28:23,828 --> 02:28:25,762
did my married life really blossom

1034
02:28:27,765 --> 02:28:29,756
Only after travelling through
the depths of death...

1035
02:28:30,034 --> 02:28:31,695
could I reach the zenith of life

1036
02:28:32,036 --> 02:28:36,029
The zenith where I was blessed
with the nectar of love

1037
02:28:36,941 --> 02:28:39,034
Forever.
