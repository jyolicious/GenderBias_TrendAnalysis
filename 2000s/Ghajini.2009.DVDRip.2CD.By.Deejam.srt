1
00:02:59,616 --> 00:03:03,161
Brain is the most important
organ of the human body.

2
00:03:03,703 --> 00:03:07,248
The most vital component
in the human system.

3
00:03:07,624 --> 00:03:11,169
It's the brain that controls
every body part.

4
00:03:11,961 --> 00:03:16,091
Brain is the king of all
human body parts.

5
00:03:34,734 --> 00:03:36,194
Patient Name: Sanjay Singhania

6
00:03:36,403 --> 00:03:38,196
Symptom: Anti retrograde
Amnesia Short term memory loss

7
00:03:38,405 --> 00:03:40,532
Hey, look at this one.

8
00:03:43,493 --> 00:03:44,703
This one's my project.

9
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:46,538
No.

10
00:03:46,746 --> 00:03:47,664
Sir, but why?

11
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:48,707
Forget this case.

12
00:03:48,915 --> 00:03:51,042
But it's such an interesting case.

13
00:03:51,418 --> 00:03:54,129
Interesting yes,
but it's also a police case.

14
00:03:54,337 --> 00:03:54,838
But...

15
00:03:55,005 --> 00:03:56,965
Sunita, you want me to
call your parents?

16
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,551
Fine, I won't take it up.

17
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,888
But as medical students,
we want to know.

18
00:04:04,264 --> 00:04:04,723
Okay...

19
00:04:07,267 --> 00:04:11,229
That is Sanjay Singhania.

20
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:14,566
Hit on the head with an iron rod.

21
00:04:15,108 --> 00:04:17,736
After the incident,
he lost his memory.

22
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:23,491
He is unable to remember anything now.
We call it short term memory loss.

23
00:04:24,451 --> 00:04:28,246
He remembers events for
only about 15 minutes.

24
00:04:28,455 --> 00:04:29,080
Afterwards...

25
00:04:29,706 --> 00:04:30,749
he forgets everything.

26
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,085
For example, he'd ask your name...

27
00:04:34,377 --> 00:04:36,254
and in 15 minutes he will
have forgotten it.

28
00:04:37,047 --> 00:04:43,094
He recalls only fragments of the incident.
But we can't say how much of it he remembers.

29
00:04:45,388 --> 00:04:53,188
Regular tasks like eating,
drinking, driving, also his feelings...

30
00:04:53,396 --> 00:04:57,442
lie embedded in his
sub-conscious mind.

31
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,945
How does he go about
his everyday routine?

32
00:05:01,237 --> 00:05:04,449
How does a child perform
instructed tasks?

33
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:08,787
By committing to memory,
learning by rote.

34
00:05:08,995 --> 00:05:10,413
Or, by jotting things
down in writing.

35
00:05:10,747 --> 00:05:14,125
Likewise, he remembers
tasks by writing.

36
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:17,295
What was that incident?
Who assaulted him?

37
00:05:23,927 --> 00:05:25,303
This, no one knows.

38
00:05:25,595 --> 00:05:28,473
Unfortunately, he doesn't
even recall a face.

39
00:05:32,435 --> 00:05:37,315
How can someone live on like this...
I wonder, what he's doing this moment...

40
00:08:23,523 --> 00:08:24,315
Ghajini

41
00:10:49,252 --> 00:10:50,879
Killed, just like Mangesh.

42
00:10:52,422 --> 00:10:53,798
The second, this week.

43
00:11:16,946 --> 00:11:23,286
Even if I've to search every street,
I'm going to get this one in 48 hours.

44
00:11:23,953 --> 00:11:25,664
Find out who...

45
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:30,001
I must find him before the
police gets to him.

46
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:33,922
Where to?

47
00:11:38,468 --> 00:11:40,011
There...

48
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:43,515
Orchard Avenue.
Pin 400076. My street

49
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,102
We're in Orchard Avenue.

50
00:11:47,894 --> 00:11:49,521
Take the next right.

51
00:11:55,318 --> 00:11:58,196
Odyssey. It's a building on
your right. I want to go there.

52
00:12:02,575 --> 00:12:03,535
My building

53
00:12:09,082 --> 00:12:10,375
73 Rupees.

54
00:12:11,251 --> 00:12:12,293
Whose address is it?

55
00:12:13,336 --> 00:12:13,962
Mine.

56
00:12:58,965 --> 00:12:59,424
Kill him Find Ghajini

57
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:02,594
Find him Kill him

Who is Ghajini?

67
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:06,111
Revenge

Kill him

71
00:18:27,961 --> 00:18:32,090
Day before yesterday. 10 am.
From Hiranandani to Andheri Station.

72
00:18:32,298 --> 00:18:34,259
Yes, I sold that ticket.

73
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:37,095
What's written behind it?

74
00:18:39,806 --> 00:18:41,182
He paid me with a five hundred note.

75
00:18:42,142 --> 00:18:44,352
I didn't have change.
So I wrote it on the back.

76
00:18:45,145 --> 00:18:50,608
He forgot to take the change...
hey, it must be him.

77
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:51,526
Who...?

78
00:18:51,735 --> 00:18:54,112
This one always forgets.

79
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,116
Sometimes he forgets to buy a ticket,
sometimes it's the change.

80
00:18:58,575 --> 00:19:01,369
At times, he'll go on buying tickets.

81
00:19:01,578 --> 00:19:03,538
He keeps on asking the
names of bus stops.

82
00:19:03,747 --> 00:19:07,667
Can you recognise him?
- Why not... looks a strange sort,

83
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:11,796
keeps his head shaven,
has a long scar on the head.

84
00:19:12,172 --> 00:19:15,800
Every morning at ten, he takes
the bus from Hiranandani.

85
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,303
It's nine.

86
00:19:18,762 --> 00:19:20,805
We got an hour to get him. Come on.

87
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:49,668

88
00:19:50,377 --> 00:19:51,503

There he goes.

90
00:20:28,665 --> 00:20:29,541
Hey...

91
00:21:01,114 --> 00:21:01,573
Damn it.

92
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:07,871
See you in the canteen after the lecture.

93
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,597
Excuse me... excuse me, sir...

94
00:21:25,972 --> 00:21:27,015
Hi sir! I'm Sunita.

95
00:21:29,976 --> 00:21:31,603
Sunita. Final year medical student.

96
00:21:33,146 --> 00:21:34,939
You don't know me.
But I know you.

97
00:21:35,565 --> 00:21:39,944
Can I talk to you for
two minutes... please?

98
00:21:43,406 --> 00:21:47,786
As a medical student,
I want to know how...

99
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:51,706
Camera beeps

100
00:21:51,956 --> 00:21:52,791
What's that?

101
00:21:54,751 --> 00:21:55,543
My camera.

102
00:21:56,044 --> 00:21:57,003
Why is it beeping?

103
00:21:58,922 --> 00:22:00,298
It buzzes every 15 minutes.

104
00:22:00,924 --> 00:22:04,969
So that I can take photos...
of important things, people...

105
00:22:06,137 --> 00:22:07,639
to inscribe on them, to remember.

106
00:22:08,556 --> 00:22:09,224
On photos?

107
00:22:10,392 --> 00:22:10,809
Yes.

108
00:22:15,355 --> 00:22:16,064
What are you doing?

109
00:22:16,564 --> 00:22:17,649
Making notes...

110
00:22:18,316 --> 00:22:20,318
Tear it out, throw it away. Do it.

111
00:22:26,282 --> 00:22:28,576
Can I see a photo?

112
00:22:49,055 --> 00:22:50,098
My watchman

113
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,017
My doctor

114
00:22:52,225 --> 00:22:53,268
My manager

115
00:22:53,935 --> 00:22:54,769
My building

116
00:22:55,395 --> 00:22:57,772
Hiranandani? Do you live there?

117
00:22:59,107 --> 00:22:59,524
Yes.

118
00:23:01,943 --> 00:23:05,363
Can I ask...
how you got injured in the head.

119
00:23:06,281 --> 00:23:09,451
My professor told me
about some accident.

120
00:23:10,535 --> 00:23:12,537
Do you remember anything
about the incident?

121
00:23:13,788 --> 00:23:14,205
Yes

122
00:23:14,414 --> 00:23:17,709
What happened?
Who hit you?

123
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,795
We aren't friends enough for me
to confide in you.

124
00:23:21,504 --> 00:23:22,630
Sorry sir... sorry.

125
00:23:24,215 --> 00:23:25,633
I'd like to meet you again.

126
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,053
Take my photograph...

127
00:23:28,636 --> 00:23:31,097
I'll use it to remind you
when we meet again.

128
00:23:41,316 --> 00:23:43,985
One more...
one for you and one for me.

129
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:51,409
I hope I'm a friend now?
Please write on it "My Friend".

130
00:24:02,379 --> 00:24:03,088
Thanks.

131
00:24:03,296 --> 00:24:05,924
The next time we meet,
I'll show this to you.

132
00:25:20,373 --> 00:25:25,503
You think the police is incompetent?

133
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,431
My name is Sanjay.

134
00:27:00,974 --> 00:27:02,017
Sanjay Singhania.

135
00:27:12,193 --> 00:27:14,779
Business is my passion,
it's also my job.

136
00:27:15,989 --> 00:27:20,285
My dad dreamt of turning the enterprise
into India's largest cellphone company.

137
00:27:21,536 --> 00:27:23,621
His dream is now my purpose.

138
00:27:24,873 --> 00:27:27,125
And I'll leave nothing undone
in order to achieve it.

139
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,477
I live in Mumbai.
My mother was born in this city.

140
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:47,771
I share a bond with this city.

141
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:54,319
Here we are, in Air Voice.

142
00:27:55,945 --> 00:27:56,821
In my office.

143
00:27:57,864 --> 00:27:59,491
And they are my most trusted employees.

144
00:28:06,873 --> 00:28:09,668
Dad said, put all your emotions into work,

145
00:28:10,335 --> 00:28:11,503
don't get emotional about it.

146
00:28:13,838 --> 00:28:14,506
Across India,

147
00:28:14,756 --> 00:28:18,009
we're targeting a 500 million
subscriber base.

148
00:28:18,718 --> 00:28:19,594
Are you shocked?

149
00:28:20,595 --> 00:28:21,513
I can achieve it.

150
00:28:22,097 --> 00:28:24,015
And I'm not being vain,
I'm just confident.

151
00:28:25,225 --> 00:28:27,352
It's a fine line between
vanity and confidence.

152
00:28:28,144 --> 00:28:30,438
That I can achieve,
speaks my confidence.

153
00:28:31,231 --> 00:28:33,608
Only I can achieve,
would speak of my vanity.

154
00:28:34,526 --> 00:28:37,404
We need confidence,
let's build on it.

155
00:28:38,071 --> 00:28:42,909
Kindly leave vanity outside office.

156
00:28:44,494 --> 00:28:45,203
Thank you.

Hey kiddo,

161
00:29:21,156 --> 00:29:23,408
Right from my heart,
here's the order

162
00:29:23,616 --> 00:29:25,910
Just live it up,

163
00:29:26,161 --> 00:29:27,412
there are no limits,

164
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,413
no borders

165
00:29:28,997 --> 00:29:31,082
There's a heady cocktail,

166
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:33,752
in wines of merriness

167
00:29:34,044 --> 00:29:36,254
If you got a taste for life,

168
00:29:36,504 --> 00:29:38,590
toe the line of happiness

169
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:40,925
Listen, here's the secret

170
00:29:41,134 --> 00:29:43,428
There's no life in EMls,
take a deep breath

171
00:29:48,641 --> 00:29:51,102
Don't you hold back,
just give it away

172
00:29:51,353 --> 00:29:53,646
Why hide in hearts,
what you can say

173
00:29:53,855 --> 00:29:56,274
Sing and smile,

174
00:29:56,483 --> 00:29:58,943
it's what life teaches

175
00:29:59,194 --> 00:30:01,613
Swing it, beat it,

176
00:30:01,821 --> 00:30:03,948
we aren't hostages

177
00:30:04,199 --> 00:30:06,451
Swing in the rhythm of

181
00:30:14,167 --> 00:30:17,962

00:32:02,776 --> 00:32:03,526
Kalpana!

184
00:32:06,237 --> 00:32:07,697
The call sheet said nine o'clock.

185
00:32:07,781 --> 00:32:09,240
You're in at ten thirty!

186
00:32:09,449 --> 00:32:10,742
Everyone's waiting.

187
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:12,744
So much traffic today...

188
00:32:12,952 --> 00:32:16,414
Don't make excuses.
Go and change.

189
00:32:16,623 --> 00:32:17,415
Okay, sir

190
00:32:22,629 --> 00:32:24,255
Hi... am I too late?

191
00:32:27,967 --> 00:32:31,429
What life... filling in for a crowd...

192
00:32:31,638 --> 00:32:34,432
and she... preens like a superstar.

193
00:32:43,983 --> 00:32:45,777
Can I go for lights?
- And roll?

194
00:32:47,153 --> 00:32:47,779
Lights.

195
00:32:49,155 --> 00:32:51,783
Roll camera.
- Rolling.

196
00:32:52,325 --> 00:32:52,784
Action.

197
00:32:53,326 --> 00:32:55,120
Rub and scrub...

198
00:32:55,412 --> 00:32:57,455
till my hands tire

199
00:32:57,664 --> 00:32:59,124
The yellow just,
will never wear

200
00:32:59,416 --> 00:33:00,625
Camera pan.

201
00:33:02,669 --> 00:33:03,461
Action, ma'am...?

202
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:07,799
That's why you must get Kite!
Then you'll discover white

203
00:33:08,008 --> 00:33:09,968
Sparkling white in One Rupee.

204
00:33:10,176 --> 00:33:11,803
Gleaming, glistening whites

205
00:33:15,849 --> 00:33:16,641
Kalpana!

206
00:33:19,853 --> 00:33:22,981
It'll be our eighth display site
on this road.

207
00:33:23,189 --> 00:33:26,651
Are all six hoardings available?
- Three, sir.

208
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,486
Next choice?
- Over here.

209
00:33:29,696 --> 00:33:31,323
This one...

210
00:33:31,531 --> 00:33:33,325
a hoarding on the terrace...

211
00:33:33,533 --> 00:33:35,660
will be visible from the fly-over.

212
00:33:36,369 --> 00:33:37,495
Looks okay to me.

213
00:33:37,704 --> 00:33:41,166
Who lives here?
- A girl. Kalpana. We can approach her.

214
00:33:41,875 --> 00:33:42,667
Do that.

215
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:47,339
Now what?
- Battery problem.

216
00:33:47,714 --> 00:33:49,841
What's going on?
Now it's the battery...

217
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:57,349
Excuse me, can we talk to Kalpana-madam?
- Kalpana isn't "madam". Plain Kalpana.

218
00:33:57,891 --> 00:34:02,020
And you are...?
- We're from Air Voice.

219
00:34:02,228 --> 00:34:06,024
I'm Mr Sanjay Singhania's
executive assistant.

220
00:34:06,232 --> 00:34:07,359
Air Voice?

221
00:34:08,068 --> 00:34:11,696
Myself, Satveer Kohli.
I run this ad film company.

222
00:34:11,905 --> 00:34:16,701
We've done a range of ads...
soaps, oils, toothbrushes, digestive pills.

223
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:22,374
Our latest was Monkey Brand toothpowder.
You want an ad film?

224
00:34:22,582 --> 00:34:29,214
We just want to see Kalpana madam.
Mr Singhania has sent me here.

225
00:34:29,506 --> 00:34:33,218
Kalpana... is in the green room.
Go ahead.

226
00:34:35,261 --> 00:34:35,887
Excuse me, ma'am...

227
00:34:36,096 --> 00:34:37,389
Yes?

228
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:42,227
I'm Shroff. From Air Voice.

229
00:34:56,282 --> 00:34:58,076
Open the door, go in.

230
00:34:58,284 --> 00:34:59,577
Serve them tea and come out.

231
00:35:01,121 --> 00:35:03,581
Sorry, don't try to convince me.

232
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:06,418
Your boss is enchanted?
But so what?

233
00:35:06,626 --> 00:35:09,087
The proposition ought to be
acceptable to me.

234
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,257
It's a matter of love...
matter of love.

235
00:35:14,884 --> 00:35:18,596
Please madam, on behalf of my boss,
I request.

236
00:35:18,805 --> 00:35:20,265
Please think it over.

237
00:35:20,557 --> 00:35:23,768
What's there to think over?
You have heard my decision.

238
00:35:23,977 --> 00:35:25,270
Now leave, please.

239
00:35:28,314 --> 00:35:29,774
They're going.

240
00:35:39,326 --> 00:35:43,955
Madam, please...
- Tell your boss, Kalpana is displeased.

241
00:35:45,999 --> 00:35:49,461
If you change your mind,

242
00:35:50,003 --> 00:35:52,130
here's my card.

243
00:35:53,173 --> 00:35:54,632
Do call.

244
00:35:54,841 --> 00:35:55,633
Okay

245
00:35:58,178 --> 00:35:59,804
Sorry... I'll get ready in two minutes.

246
00:36:00,013 --> 00:36:00,638
Madam, one minute...

247
00:36:01,931 --> 00:36:02,974
Madam...?

248
00:36:03,183 --> 00:36:04,142
Kalpana ji...

249
00:36:05,602 --> 00:36:06,811
Ji...?

250
00:36:11,024 --> 00:36:14,986
I apologise for intruding upon
your personal affairs.

251
00:36:15,195 --> 00:36:19,991
But all of us heard whatever
went on inside.

252
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:25,497
Spot boy, find a chair for madam.

253
00:36:25,872 --> 00:36:28,333
Let me surmise what might've happened.

254
00:36:29,209 --> 00:36:33,672
Sanjay Singhania saw you somewhere.

255
00:36:34,047 --> 00:36:34,839
And when he saw you,

256
00:36:35,048 --> 00:36:40,011
it was love at first sight.
Thereby hangs a question.

257
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:45,016
He pins his hopes on a yes from you,
it's why he sent his men to you.

258
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:54,192
And you for one, are putting him away?
Am I correct, madam? Correct?

259
00:36:56,236 --> 00:36:58,530
Yes, correct.

260
00:36:59,406 --> 00:37:03,868
Why are you spurning
a fine proposition?

261
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,709
Today, it's a man who owns Air Voice.
Tomorrow, it'll be a Bill Gates.

262
00:37:10,917 --> 00:37:15,213
Am I to just to capitulate?
After all, my choice matters!

263
00:37:15,422 --> 00:37:19,050
Think, what a wonderful
opportunity it is!

264
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:23,388
On a nod from you, our company will be
transported to such heights!

265
00:37:24,097 --> 00:37:28,560
You must've done a deed of great virtue.
Just say a prayer and take the plunge!

266
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:33,898
Allow me... I'll call.
- Sir... oh, but no...

267
00:37:36,609 --> 00:37:39,404
Ringing... talk.
- Talk.

268
00:37:41,948 --> 00:37:43,575
Air Voice. Can I help you?

269
00:37:45,452 --> 00:37:46,411
Hello...

270
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,080
This is Kalpana.

271
00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:51,416
Kalpana... who...?

272
00:37:53,126 --> 00:37:54,753
Oh, Kalpana of the terrace-hoarding?

273
00:37:55,211 --> 00:38:00,759
We found out about you.
The house isn't yours.

274
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:03,762
You haven't paid rent in two months.

275
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:07,098
And you're playing hard to get?
Get lost.

276
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:12,103
That office is all shook-up!

277
00:38:12,395 --> 00:38:14,439
Keep talking.

278
00:38:16,316 --> 00:38:19,944
Go to your boss and tell him,

279
00:38:20,153 --> 00:38:22,280
Kalpana said yes.

280
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,957
So what if it isn't gold?
It still shines.

281
00:38:33,166 --> 00:38:36,795
Nathumal Gendamal Jewellers.
42 Link Road, Malad West.

282
00:38:37,003 --> 00:38:38,963
We have no branches.

283
00:38:40,507 --> 00:38:43,635
Mom, in whom do we trust?

284
00:38:43,843 --> 00:38:50,141
In mother first, you must trust.
Only another thing, everyone trusts.

285
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,309
It's our soap. Hamam.

286
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,494
Sir... why must you...?

287
00:39:10,036 --> 00:39:11,496
It doesn't matter, my child.

288
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:18,169
Kalpana, I want to tell you
about something.

289
00:39:18,878 --> 00:39:21,339
An ad film agent is coming here.

290
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:23,675
He's into the big agencies.

291
00:39:24,718 --> 00:39:26,845
What if he gets to know that...

292
00:39:27,053 --> 00:39:32,684
Sanjay Singhania is romancing
our lead model?

293
00:39:34,894 --> 00:39:35,645
Then...?

294
00:39:35,895 --> 00:39:37,689
It'll be a great boost for us.

295
00:39:38,565 --> 00:39:41,359
How long will we keep
making small films?

296
00:39:41,735 --> 00:39:44,529
Our company needs
national clients.

297
00:39:44,821 --> 00:39:46,698
Sir, consider it done.

298
00:39:47,407 --> 00:39:52,037
Kalpana is like a magic wand!
One flourish and yesterday's gone.

299
00:39:52,245 --> 00:39:52,871
Don't worry.

300
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:02,547
Excuse me... I'm doing an article on
struggling models for Mayapuri.

301
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:06,718
Can I interview some models?
- In the green room.

302
00:40:09,095 --> 00:40:12,724
Excuse me...?
- Oh, welcome.

303
00:40:13,433 --> 00:40:14,893
Be seated.
- Thank you.

304
00:40:15,101 --> 00:40:16,895
My director said
you'd be coming.

305
00:40:17,604 --> 00:40:18,396
Really?

306
00:40:18,855 --> 00:40:21,399
Setting up these sets
takes so much time.

307
00:40:21,941 --> 00:40:24,903
And I got to get to the airport.
Sanjay is flying in.

308
00:40:25,111 --> 00:40:25,904
Sanjay who?

309
00:40:27,113 --> 00:40:28,573
Sanjay Singhania.

310
00:40:28,865 --> 00:40:30,408
Of Air Voice.

311
00:40:31,117 --> 00:40:32,410
My lover.

312
00:40:33,453 --> 00:40:35,413
Sanjay Singhania?
Your lover?

313
00:40:35,622 --> 00:40:38,750
Yes, you know... actually,

314
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:41,252
we met at Delhi airport.

315
00:40:41,961 --> 00:40:47,759
I never knew he's Sanjay Singhania.
In the airport lobby, he kept staring at me.

316
00:40:48,885 --> 00:40:55,767
On the flight, he was on the seat beside me.
Hi, I'm Sanjay Singhania... and I said hi.

317
00:40:55,975 --> 00:40:58,937
That's when I discovered who he is.

318
00:40:59,145 --> 00:41:01,773
One minute...
can I write it down?

319
00:41:01,981 --> 00:41:04,275
Yes, why not?
You won't believe this...

320
00:41:04,651 --> 00:41:07,779
From Delhi to Bombay,
he talked non-stop.

321
00:41:07,988 --> 00:41:11,783
Plain chatter. I could only
listen on.

322
00:41:11,992 --> 00:41:12,951
Then all of a sudden,

323
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,619
I love you.

324
00:41:15,328 --> 00:41:16,621
Will you marry me?

325
00:41:18,373 --> 00:41:22,961
I say, are you silly.
Are marriages made in thin air?

326
00:41:24,504 --> 00:41:28,633
Back in Bombay, I'm inundated
with phone calls and smses.

327
00:41:28,925 --> 00:41:30,301
I never gave him much of a lift.

328
00:41:42,355 --> 00:41:44,649
In the end, I took pity on him.

329
00:41:44,941 --> 00:41:47,819
So I decided to say yes.

330
00:41:53,533 --> 00:41:55,994
This week's breaking news,
right inside Mayapuri.

331
00:41:56,286 --> 00:42:01,499
Business tycoon Sanjay Singhania in
an affair with an aspiring model.

332
00:42:01,708 --> 00:42:04,336
Read about it in
Kalpana's own words.

333
00:42:04,544 --> 00:42:11,176
Two packs of "MDH Masala" free
with this week's edition

334
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:17,515
Hello...?

335
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:23,188
I don't know who she is,
I haven't even seen her face.

336
00:42:23,563 --> 00:42:24,689
Please don't disturb me.

337
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,859
Hello...?

338
00:42:29,736 --> 00:42:30,862
It's all lies.

339
00:42:32,238 --> 00:42:33,865
How do I know why
she's saying all this?

340
00:42:34,908 --> 00:42:36,534
No, please talk to me later.

341
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,373
No more calls.

342
00:42:44,084 --> 00:42:45,210
Does it have
her photos?

343
00:42:45,418 --> 00:42:48,046
Neither yours, nor hers.

344
00:42:50,507 --> 00:42:52,133
I want to meet her. Find out.

345
00:43:07,941 --> 00:43:11,236
What do we do now?
- It's impossible. Do we return?

346
00:43:11,444 --> 00:43:16,449
Wait, let's see how we can go inside.

347
00:43:26,626 --> 00:43:30,755
Something happened...?
- The children are here to see the museum.

348
00:43:30,964 --> 00:43:32,090
What are we to do?

349
00:43:40,807 --> 00:43:41,599
One second.

350
00:43:51,484 --> 00:43:53,445
Careful while you get
your feet into it.

351
00:44:36,363 --> 00:44:38,156
So sweet.

352
00:44:42,202 --> 00:44:43,828
Bye.
- Bye.

353
00:45:11,231 --> 00:45:12,357
Sir, should I go in?

354
00:45:12,565 --> 00:45:13,358
Wait here.

355
00:45:17,988 --> 00:45:20,448
Excuse me, who's Kalpana?
- Up on the terrace.

356
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:24,452
My name's Sachin. Like, Sachin Tendulkar.
Recommend me, please.

357
00:45:24,828 --> 00:45:26,955
Congratulations for the good news.
- Thank you.

358
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:30,959
Excuse me... I'll see
what I can do.

359
00:45:31,835 --> 00:45:33,920
Hello... thanks.

360
00:45:34,129 --> 00:45:35,839
Did you send the photographs?

361
00:45:36,047 --> 00:45:36,840
Excuse me.

362
00:45:41,344 --> 00:45:42,345
One second.

363
00:45:42,971 --> 00:45:44,305
Yes... I'll talk to you later.

364
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:46,641
Yes?

365
00:45:49,394 --> 00:45:50,020
Kalpana...?

366
00:45:50,228 --> 00:45:51,521
Yes, I am... go on.

367
00:45:53,148 --> 00:45:59,863
I... read the news in Mayapuri.

368
00:46:00,071 --> 00:46:07,829
Not Mayapuri again... what a day of calls,
autographs, photographs, bouquets, smses.

369
00:46:08,038 --> 00:46:12,500
I didn't tell my story for all this...
Sanjay must be so annoyed.

370
00:46:12,834 --> 00:46:13,668
Sanjay...?

371
00:46:13,877 --> 00:46:15,378
Sanjay Singhania.

372
00:46:17,047 --> 00:46:18,006
Actually,

373
00:46:18,214 --> 00:46:20,342
we met at Delhi airport.

374
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:23,303
I never knew he's Sanjay Singhania.

375
00:46:23,887 --> 00:46:27,682
In the airport lobby,
he kept staring at me.

376
00:46:28,975 --> 00:46:31,686
On the flight,
he was on the seat beside me.

377
00:46:32,729 --> 00:46:36,524
Hi, I'm Sanjay Singhania...
and I said hi.

378
00:46:37,817 --> 00:46:46,201
That's when I discovered who he is.
From Delhi to Bombay, he talked non-stop.

379
00:46:46,409 --> 00:46:50,372
Plain chatter.
I could only listen on.

380
00:46:50,664 --> 00:46:53,041
Then all of a sudden, "I love you."

381
00:46:54,125 --> 00:46:55,335
Will you marry me?

382
00:46:57,879 --> 00:47:02,717
I say, are you silly.
Are marriages made in thin air?

383
00:47:04,219 --> 00:47:05,178
I said, no.

384
00:47:05,804 --> 00:47:06,846
He said, please.

385
00:47:07,681 --> 00:47:09,224
I said no, he kept on...
please...

386
00:47:09,432 --> 00:47:10,809
I said, okay.

387
00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:15,063
How can you say no to
such persistence?

388
00:47:16,439 --> 00:47:18,942
That was the long and short of it.

389
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:22,487
This magazine had to print this
and now everyone's after me,

390
00:47:22,737 --> 00:47:26,491
for recommendations,
advertisements.

391
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:37,544
Are you here for the ad shoot?

392
00:47:38,878 --> 00:47:41,715
Well I...

393
00:47:42,632 --> 00:47:45,260
Everyone wears suits for the auditions.

394
00:47:46,636 --> 00:47:48,763
Have you been selected for the ad?

395
00:47:50,598 --> 00:47:52,934
Do you want me to recommend you?

396
00:47:53,476 --> 00:47:55,520
But it's the talent that you need.

397
00:47:56,146 --> 00:47:58,606
Don't set your sights
on Van Heusen Suitings.

398
00:47:58,982 --> 00:48:02,068
Do what comes your way,
papads, mosquito coils.

399
00:48:03,653 --> 00:48:04,279
Catch this.

400
00:48:05,405 --> 00:48:08,199
Now let's hear you say,
here's one for men.

401
00:48:09,492 --> 00:48:14,039
For the bounce in the hair for alpha males...
a comb. Let's hear you say that.

402
00:48:29,346 --> 00:48:30,638
Never did it before?

403
00:48:33,099 --> 00:48:35,602
Very poor...
got to put in hard work.

404
00:48:37,604 --> 00:48:40,982
Leave your number.
If anything comes up, I'll call.

405
00:48:47,489 --> 00:48:48,907
What's your number?

406
00:48:57,582 --> 00:48:59,084
Air Voice?

407
00:48:59,751 --> 00:49:00,960
Same as mine.

408
00:49:01,378 --> 00:49:02,379
Crap.

409
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,173
You don't find a network anywhere.

410
00:49:05,423 --> 00:49:09,010
I keep telling Sanjay, to try turning
the antenna or something.

411
00:49:10,387 --> 00:49:14,391
It may be his pocket borough,
but it ought to meet some standard.

412
00:49:18,687 --> 00:49:21,189
Hi Anjali... one second...

413
00:49:21,398 --> 00:49:22,607
What did you say your name was?

414
00:49:24,401 --> 00:49:25,110
Sachin?

415
00:49:25,902 --> 00:49:26,611
Yes.

416
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:30,156
Sachin, I'm a bit busy.
If something comes up, I'll call. Bye.

417
00:49:30,448 --> 00:49:31,324
Yes Anjali...

418
00:49:33,743 --> 00:49:38,289
you know what happened?
Mayapuri just splashed my love story.

419
00:49:38,498 --> 00:49:42,377
And now all day, I've been inundated
with calls, smses, oh, I'm drained.

420
00:49:42,585 --> 00:49:48,049
No! Actually,
we only met at Delhi airport.

421
00:49:48,299 --> 00:49:50,593
On the flight,
he was on the seat beside me.

422
00:49:50,802 --> 00:49:54,347
Hi, I'm Sanjay Singhania...
and I said hi.

423
00:49:55,098 --> 00:49:58,810
From Delhi to Bombay,
he talked non-stop.

424
00:50:00,687 --> 00:50:04,190
After completing law, I went to USA
and I took my MBA at Harvard.

425
00:50:04,774 --> 00:50:07,777
I've been looking after this business
since my father passed away.

426
00:50:08,737 --> 00:50:13,325
I strongly feel that technology has to reach
people beyond social and economic barriers.

427
00:50:13,533 --> 00:50:14,534
And that's the goal of our company.

428
00:50:17,495 --> 00:50:20,165
I'm so sorry... cellphones,
I tell you...

429
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:22,208
Excuse me.

430
00:50:22,417 --> 00:50:22,959
Hello?

431
00:50:23,209 --> 00:50:25,086
Hello, I'm Kalpana.

432
00:50:25,295 --> 00:50:27,672
Kalpana... which Kalpana?

433
00:50:27,881 --> 00:50:31,468
Kalpana... Sanjay Singhania's girlfriend.

434
00:50:31,676 --> 00:50:35,930
Oh I see... how have you been?

435
00:50:36,306 --> 00:50:37,015
I'm good.

436
00:50:37,223 --> 00:50:38,892
Will you do an underwear ad?

437
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:39,809
Underwear?

438
00:50:44,981 --> 00:50:46,775
Along with you?

439
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:48,943
It's a men's only.

440
00:50:50,111 --> 00:50:52,405
Come over quickly.
Take down the address.

441
00:50:53,698 --> 00:50:54,908
One minute.

442
00:50:55,325 --> 00:50:58,703
Mark... make a note of
this address, please.

443
00:50:58,912 --> 00:50:59,663
Go on.

444
00:51:00,038 --> 00:51:04,292
Building 3. Chinchpokli Bunder.
Khau Galli.

445
00:51:04,501 --> 00:51:08,922
Building 3. Chinchpokli Bunder. Khau Galli.
- I beg your pardon, sir...?

446
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:13,093
Chinchpokli Bunder. Khau Galli.

447
00:51:13,385 --> 00:51:15,804
Chi...?
- Chinchpokli.

448
00:51:16,012 --> 00:51:18,723
Chinchbokli?
...Pokli Bunder. Khau Galli.

449
00:51:20,266 --> 00:51:22,143
Khau... Galli.
- Galli.

450
00:51:23,561 --> 00:51:24,604
Got it.
- Thanks.

451
00:51:24,854 --> 00:51:28,400
Arrive in an autorickshaw,
you'll make a nice impression.

452
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:32,195
D'you have the money for it?
- I'll manage.

453
00:51:32,404 --> 00:51:33,154
Fine.

454
00:51:33,363 --> 00:51:35,156
I'll be waiting for you.
Bye.

455
00:51:41,705 --> 00:51:44,874
It's just too hot today...
- Are you new to Mumbai?

456
00:51:45,792 --> 00:51:48,795
Come in the rains, here rivers flow.

457
00:51:53,717 --> 00:51:55,802
Moron! Can't you drive properly?

458
00:51:56,052 --> 00:51:56,886
Sorry...

459
00:51:57,679 --> 00:51:58,847
Why are you saying sorry?

460
00:51:59,055 --> 00:52:02,267
Pedestrians are taking up roads,
are we meant to fly?

461
00:52:04,352 --> 00:52:05,228
Drive carefully.

462
00:52:05,437 --> 00:52:06,187
Get out of my way.

463
00:52:09,399 --> 00:52:11,026
How much?
- Forty Rupees.

464
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:21,369
Boo

465
00:52:23,621 --> 00:52:25,999
You're gawking like a country bumpkin.

466
00:52:26,416 --> 00:52:29,836
The manager wants a new model.
I thought of you.

467
00:52:31,421 --> 00:52:33,882
What's this ad about?

468
00:52:34,632 --> 00:52:36,051
Zorro elastic underwear.

469
00:52:36,426 --> 00:52:39,429
If you make it to this ad,
you've made it.

470
00:52:39,637 --> 00:52:42,557
Just imagine yourself in
your underwear...

471
00:52:42,766 --> 00:52:45,643
at every traffic junction in town,

472
00:52:45,852 --> 00:52:49,648
on sixty feet-by-forty feet banners!

473
00:52:50,607 --> 00:52:52,609
Your luck is going to change.

474
00:52:52,942 --> 00:52:55,362
Don't worry, you're getting selected.

475
00:52:56,404 --> 00:52:58,239
Can't I get any other ad?

476
00:52:59,115 --> 00:53:01,076
Yes... how about one
on skin allergies?

477
00:53:01,785 --> 00:53:02,452
Allergies...?

478
00:53:02,661 --> 00:53:05,580
Salves, for ringworm infections.

479
00:53:05,789 --> 00:53:08,541
Then the first choice is better.
- Okay.

480
00:53:08,833 --> 00:53:10,877
Hello ma'am!
- Hi...

481
00:53:11,086 --> 00:53:13,797
You said you'd recommend me
for the underwear ad...?

482
00:53:14,005 --> 00:53:21,429
The underwear is taken, how about ringworm?
- I'll take anything, I want a break.

483
00:53:21,638 --> 00:53:22,972
That's the spirit.

484
00:53:23,223 --> 00:53:23,765
See?

485
00:53:23,973 --> 00:53:24,808
Come to the studio tomorrow morning.

486
00:53:25,016 --> 00:53:27,143
Thank you, ma'am!
- You're welcome.

487
00:53:30,939 --> 00:53:31,856
Wait a minute.

488
00:53:36,778 --> 00:53:40,073
Uncle, where are you headed?
- To the bus stop ahead.

489
00:53:40,281 --> 00:53:41,741
I'll take you there.

490
00:53:43,493 --> 00:53:46,204
I'll describe to you
whatever's on the way.

491
00:53:46,413 --> 00:53:47,038
Okay.

492
00:53:48,331 --> 00:53:51,292
Four schoolgirls playing tic tac toe.

493
00:53:57,215 --> 00:53:59,801
A wife thrashing her husband.

494
00:54:00,468 --> 00:54:02,137
He has lost his shirt.

495
00:54:06,516 --> 00:54:08,518
That's a radio at the tea shop.

496
00:54:12,105 --> 00:54:14,482
We're crossing Sai Baba's temple.

497
00:54:19,612 --> 00:54:21,781
Now we're on the main road.

498
00:54:24,743 --> 00:54:27,245
You've reached your bus stop.

499
00:55:05,825 --> 00:55:07,744
I'm swayed

500
00:55:07,952 --> 00:55:09,120
She flew in...

501
00:55:09,329 --> 00:55:10,955
like a swirl of wind

502
00:55:11,164 --> 00:55:13,166
With that first look,

503
00:55:13,375 --> 00:55:15,418
she held my eyes

504
00:55:15,627 --> 00:55:16,586
So unlikely,

505
00:55:16,795 --> 00:55:18,421
she's so different,

506
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:19,589
so unique,

507
00:55:19,798 --> 00:55:23,176
so unpretentious,

508
00:55:23,385 --> 00:55:25,553
and just no attitude

509
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:30,475
So, I'm swayed

510
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:35,271
And a freshness fills my heart

511
00:55:35,855 --> 00:55:41,069
You're swayed when she flies
in on a swirl of wind

512
00:55:41,277 --> 00:55:45,573
And with that first look,
oh how she holds your eyes

513
00:56:18,606 --> 00:56:20,984
The heart went aflutter,

514
00:56:21,192 --> 00:56:23,194
dancing to a new rhythm

515
00:56:23,403 --> 00:56:25,363
My feet faltered

516
00:56:25,572 --> 00:56:28,283
I swooned in ecstasy

517
00:56:28,491 --> 00:56:30,785
I stood each day, staring her way

518
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:33,330
In endless wake, moments stretch

519
00:56:33,538 --> 00:56:35,248
Twisting, turning, tossing, thinking

520
00:56:35,457 --> 00:56:38,293
Thinking, thinking of you

521
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:51,014
Her images criss-cross my mind,

522
00:56:51,222 --> 00:56:53,183
awash in colours

523
00:56:53,391 --> 00:56:56,144
Like a gushing stream she flows,

524
00:56:56,353 --> 00:57:01,941
drenching me

525
00:57:03,443 --> 00:57:07,030
Her murmurs make music

526
00:57:08,323 --> 00:57:11,993
Her trivia are priceless

527
00:57:13,161 --> 00:57:15,622
Some innocence,
sweet mischief

528
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:17,832
Somewhat gossamer,
some odd gloss

529
00:57:18,041 --> 00:57:20,543
At times bashful, then carefree

530
00:57:20,752 --> 00:57:23,588
There are seas in her, but how deep?

531
00:58:18,601 --> 00:58:23,565
Her words could make
Spring blossom

532
00:58:26,067 --> 00:58:31,114
Her charm could make
seasons spring

533
00:58:33,491 --> 00:58:35,368
Even her lies...

534
00:58:35,577 --> 00:58:36,619
are so endearing,

535
00:58:36,828 --> 00:58:40,206
she could make me believe
illusions in all things

536
00:58:41,207 --> 00:58:46,171
Upon her many paths,
praying, hoping, eager-eyed,

537
00:58:46,379 --> 00:58:51,092
musing fragrant shades of memories,
I stand still and...

538
00:58:51,301 --> 00:58:53,094
Time stands stilled

539
00:59:25,835 --> 00:59:35,804
BIGPictures

540
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:07,627
Good morning, sir!
- Good morning.

541
01:00:07,836 --> 01:00:12,716
Sit down, my child. Guess what,
our company is going to be famous.

542
01:00:12,841 --> 01:00:14,467
Thanks only to you...
- Why are you thanking me?

543
01:00:14,676 --> 01:00:17,637
I've done something
without asking you.

544
01:00:18,555 --> 01:00:23,643
Our company is throwing a
big party on New Year's Eve.

545
01:00:23,852 --> 01:00:24,936
Oh, wow!

546
01:00:25,353 --> 01:00:26,980
Guess, who's the chief guest?

547
01:00:27,188 --> 01:00:27,856
Who...?

548
01:00:28,064 --> 01:00:29,774
Your boyfriend.

549
01:00:30,025 --> 01:00:31,860
The man who owns Air Voice.

550
01:00:32,068 --> 01:00:35,572
Sanjay Singhania.

551
01:00:35,905 --> 01:00:36,489
Sir...?

552
01:00:37,032 --> 01:00:40,869
And come what may,
you must get him to come.

553
01:00:41,536 --> 01:00:45,957
I'm sure you can, so I went ahead and
printed his name in the invitations.

554
01:00:46,875 --> 01:00:51,838
The biggest of agencies are coming,
top ad film makers, producers, directors.

555
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:55,508
On whose say-so have
you printed his name?

556
01:00:55,717 --> 01:00:57,302
Where's the need to ask...?

557
01:00:58,762 --> 01:01:01,431
It's the New Years Eve party.
You're coming.

558
01:01:01,639 --> 01:01:05,060
He'll accompany you.
- But I can't invite him!

559
01:01:05,727 --> 01:01:06,186
Why?

560
01:01:07,729 --> 01:01:09,856
We've... had a fight!

561
01:01:11,066 --> 01:01:13,610
You don't say!
All invitations have been distributed.

562
01:01:13,818 --> 01:01:16,363
You've got to make up with him
...got to get him to the party.

563
01:01:16,613 --> 01:01:18,239
But how...?
- Otherwise, I'll lose face.

564
01:01:18,406 --> 01:01:21,326
On whose say-so did you print this?

565
01:01:21,618 --> 01:01:25,246
I would've told you,
but it slipped my mind.

566
01:01:25,455 --> 01:01:28,249
What you've done is so wrong,
hundred percent wrong!

567
01:01:28,458 --> 01:01:32,545
Please, or you'll break everyone's heart.
- Where will I get Sanjay Singhania?

568
01:01:32,754 --> 01:01:36,174
Everyone's dying to see him,
not one of us has ever met him.

569
01:01:38,635 --> 01:01:39,219
What...?

570
01:01:40,178 --> 01:01:41,388
What about what?

571
01:01:42,263 --> 01:01:44,933
Not one of us has ever met him?

572
01:01:45,183 --> 01:01:47,602
How could we?
He has just returned from America.

573
01:01:48,436 --> 01:01:49,980
Then I just...
must get him.

574
01:01:50,605 --> 01:01:52,607
Consider it done

575
01:01:52,857 --> 01:01:57,070
Kalpana is like a magic wand!
One flourish and you've got your wish.

576
01:01:57,821 --> 01:01:59,489
Thank you very much

577
01:02:04,995 --> 01:02:06,788
Dialogue... dialogue!

578
01:02:07,247 --> 01:02:10,959
Hi, I'm Sanjay. Sanjay Singhania.

579
01:02:11,167 --> 01:02:12,210
Perfect.

580
01:02:13,003 --> 01:02:13,920
Very good.

581
01:02:14,796 --> 01:02:15,672
Mind it.

582
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:19,092
At tonight's party,
you're Sanjay Singhania.

583
01:02:20,969 --> 01:02:21,761
One second...

584
01:02:27,309 --> 01:02:31,354
Listen, that's a friend of mine.
You'll pretend to be Sanjay Singhania.

585
01:02:31,646 --> 01:02:34,524
If he's convinced,
then you pass muster. Okay?

586
01:02:37,068 --> 01:02:37,861
Ready?

587
01:02:40,196 --> 01:02:40,780
Hi...

588
01:02:40,989 --> 01:02:42,741
Hush!

589
01:02:43,158 --> 01:02:43,783
What happened?

590
01:02:44,826 --> 01:02:45,785
Sanjay is here.

591
01:02:45,994 --> 01:02:46,703
Sanjay?

592
01:02:47,495 --> 01:02:49,497
Sanjay Singhania, my boyfriend.

593
01:03:03,845 --> 01:03:06,014
Where... is he?
- Where are you looking...?

594
01:03:06,848 --> 01:03:07,349
Here!

595
01:03:08,683 --> 01:03:09,434
Sachin,

596
01:03:09,726 --> 01:03:10,977
meet Mr Sanjay.

597
01:03:11,853 --> 01:03:15,023
Hi, I'm Sanjay. Sanjay Singhania.

598
01:03:15,565 --> 01:03:16,650
What... who...?

599
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:21,154
He is... Sanjay Singhania.

600
01:03:21,363 --> 01:03:22,030
Him...?

601
01:03:25,367 --> 01:03:28,036
Are you joking?
Sanjay Singhania, and him?

602
01:03:43,551 --> 01:03:46,262
Stupid amateur, duffer, idiot!

603
01:03:46,471 --> 01:03:48,264
What did I do...?

604
01:03:48,473 --> 01:03:52,811
The big fish never put out their hands first.
Why did you hold out your hand?

605
01:03:53,311 --> 01:03:56,940
So when do I shake hands?
- You just don't do it!

606
01:03:57,148 --> 01:03:59,651
Go to hell, go do ads!
You've ruined it all.

607
01:04:01,653 --> 01:04:02,320
Idiot!

608
01:04:05,573 --> 01:04:06,366
What happened?

609
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:10,495
Sachin, shall I tell you something?

610
01:04:10,704 --> 01:04:11,287
What?

611
01:04:11,496 --> 01:04:13,498
You're going to be stunned...

612
01:04:13,957 --> 01:04:14,624
Try me.

613
01:04:14,833 --> 01:04:17,627
I'm not in love with Sanjay Singhania.

614
01:04:18,169 --> 01:04:18,670
What?

615
01:04:21,589 --> 01:04:22,841
Actually,

616
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,593
everyone at my workplace thought...

617
01:04:25,802 --> 01:04:27,178
he's my boyfriend.

618
01:04:28,388 --> 01:04:30,348
So, everyone began to respect me.

619
01:04:33,059 --> 01:04:34,769
I played along.

620
01:04:36,604 --> 01:04:39,607
I don't even know what he looks like!

621
01:04:41,735 --> 01:04:43,903
So... what's next?

622
01:04:44,612 --> 01:04:46,573
My boss is hosting a party tonight.

623
01:04:46,781 --> 01:04:50,285
Without even asking me, they sent out
invites naming Sanjay as the chief guest.

624
01:04:50,493 --> 01:04:55,081
So I was preparing this mule for tonight,
but you caught him out in a second!

625
01:04:56,082 --> 01:04:58,084
What am I going to do now?

626
01:04:59,544 --> 01:05:01,838
Relax... I'm right here for you.

627
01:05:02,339 --> 01:05:03,923
I'll train him.

628
01:05:05,258 --> 01:05:06,801
Listen... what's your name?

629
01:05:07,427 --> 01:05:12,766
Hi, I'm Sanjay. Sanjay Singhania.
- No... your real name?

630
01:05:13,183 --> 01:05:14,809
Sampat.
- Look Sampat...

631
01:05:15,644 --> 01:05:17,228
cut that extra swagger.

632
01:05:17,437 --> 01:05:19,689
Be relaxed and easy... confident.

633
01:05:20,273 --> 01:05:22,984
Let me show how...
Hi, I'm Sanjay... Sanjay Singhania.

634
01:05:23,193 --> 01:05:28,448
Stop. Don't teach me acting.
I belong in theatre, I've done four plays.

635
01:05:28,657 --> 01:05:31,618
I was putting out a first class act,
then he walked in and things went awry.

636
01:05:31,826 --> 01:05:33,495
Hey... take off that coat.

637
01:05:34,496 --> 01:05:37,999
Take it off, get out of that coat!
- I have a shoot tomorrow. It's my only coat.

638
01:05:38,208 --> 01:05:41,961
I just canceled your shoot. You're good only
for rubber slippers, snap out of it!

639
01:05:44,839 --> 01:05:45,674
Who, me...?
- Wear it.

640
01:05:54,307 --> 01:05:57,227
Oh yes!
You are... looking smart.

641
01:05:58,561 --> 01:05:59,521
Put on the goggles.

642
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:06,069
Oh wow!

643
01:06:06,861 --> 01:06:07,821
Perfect!

644
01:06:09,489 --> 01:06:10,365
Perfect!

645
01:06:11,533 --> 01:06:15,328
Sachin! Come for tonight's party.
Be Sanjay.

646
01:06:16,204 --> 01:06:17,288
Please?

647
01:06:17,831 --> 01:06:19,290
Please say yes!

648
01:06:20,083 --> 01:06:20,917
Please!

649
01:06:22,627 --> 01:06:23,545
Please say yes...?

650
01:06:24,546 --> 01:06:25,005
Okay.

651
01:06:25,505 --> 01:06:25,964
Yes!

652
01:06:26,172 --> 01:06:28,883
Welcome to our chief guest,
Mr Sanjay Singhania

653
01:06:36,558 --> 01:06:37,559
Oh hi...
- Hello.

654
01:06:39,269 --> 01:06:41,271
Having a nice time?
- Yes, thank you.

655
01:06:45,608 --> 01:06:46,276
Kalpana

656
01:06:46,943 --> 01:06:49,237
Did you invite him properly?
- Yes, sir!

657
01:06:50,196 --> 01:06:54,242
If he turns up for real,
everyone'll go mad.

658
01:06:56,286 --> 01:06:57,579
If he doesn't turn up,

659
01:06:58,538 --> 01:06:59,914
then I'll go mad.

660
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,712
Madam...

661
01:07:06,921 --> 01:07:11,676
The coat is ready. Just give me the go
and I'll give you a grand entry.

662
01:07:11,885 --> 01:07:14,220
I've rehearsed it thoroughly.

663
01:07:15,555 --> 01:07:18,433
I'm Sanjay Singhania...
oh hello Sanjay.

664
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:21,478
Get out of my face.

665
01:07:21,728 --> 01:07:22,854
You fool!

666
01:07:25,732 --> 01:07:27,233
Hi Kalpana...
- Hi!

667
01:07:27,942 --> 01:07:29,069
Mr Singhania has arrived.

668
01:07:45,335 --> 01:07:49,214
Who told him to get a car like that?
I'm not footing this bill.

669
01:07:50,131 --> 01:07:53,301
Oh... thank you.

670
01:07:53,843 --> 01:07:54,678
How wonderful!

671
01:07:55,261 --> 01:08:00,392
He hasn't begun acting and all these fools have
already taken him for Sanjay Singhania?

672
01:08:01,601 --> 01:08:02,769
Oh yes, yes...

673
01:08:03,812 --> 01:08:04,562
Will you hold this, please?

674
01:08:05,605 --> 01:08:06,606
Hi darling!

675
01:08:07,857 --> 01:08:10,193
Sorry, I'm late... my God!
You're looking gorgeous... come.

676
01:08:10,402 --> 01:08:12,946
Welcome to this party.
- Thank you.

677
01:08:14,781 --> 01:08:15,573
Hello... hello...

678
01:08:15,782 --> 01:08:17,117
Hello sir!

679
01:08:17,993 --> 01:08:18,493
Sorry.

680
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:19,953
Welcome, sir.
- Thank you.

681
01:08:20,161 --> 01:08:24,791
Myself, Satveer Kohli. I'm Kalpana's director
and I run this ad film company.

682
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,627
Hello sir, how are you?
- Thank you sir, I'm very good.

683
01:08:28,169 --> 01:08:31,506
I happen to be the one who insisted that
Kalpana must say yes to you.

684
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:33,508
I see...?

685
01:08:34,050 --> 01:08:36,761
You never told him!
- Of course I told him...

686
01:08:37,053 --> 01:08:39,431
I told you...?
- Oh... yes...

687
01:08:39,639 --> 01:08:40,807
Autograph, please?

688
01:08:42,309 --> 01:08:46,187
I read your article in Economic Times.
I fully agree with your policy suggestions.

689
01:08:46,354 --> 01:08:49,941
Please leave him alone...
don't disturb him.

690
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:52,110
Please come, dinner is ready.

691
01:08:59,659 --> 01:09:00,910
That was too close an embrace.

692
01:09:03,038 --> 01:09:05,165
And that was a kiss in public.

693
01:09:07,876 --> 01:09:09,502
I've done a hundred ads.

694
01:09:09,878 --> 01:09:12,422
Ninety in groups. Ten, solo.

695
01:09:12,881 --> 01:09:16,885
You learn how to respect your seniors or,
you're getting nowhere in life.

696
01:09:22,557 --> 01:09:24,017
I don't believe this.

697
01:09:24,934 --> 01:09:25,602
What?

698
01:09:25,894 --> 01:09:27,145
I just can't believe...

699
01:09:27,354 --> 01:09:29,147
Why not...?

700
01:09:29,356 --> 01:09:32,609
Can't believe that I'm sitting
in such august presence...

701
01:09:33,693 --> 01:09:35,445
Still, he's right amongst us.

702
01:09:39,616 --> 01:09:40,325
Excuse me...

703
01:09:44,204 --> 01:09:45,413
Some ice, please?

704
01:09:45,872 --> 01:09:47,415
So much cold is good enough for you.

705
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:51,836
Over-acting. He'll get caught.

706
01:09:52,128 --> 01:09:53,713
Please get lost.

707
01:09:57,592 --> 01:09:58,551
Excuse me...

708
01:09:59,386 --> 01:10:01,805
We're from the Dinanath Charitable Trust.

709
01:10:02,222 --> 01:10:03,932
It's an orphanage for girls.

710
01:10:04,099 --> 01:10:05,225
And...?

711
01:10:05,433 --> 01:10:07,852
If you may make a contribution,
we'll be grateful.

712
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:10,522
Who goes around with cash nowadays?

713
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:12,148
Your cheque will do.

714
01:10:13,608 --> 01:10:14,442
Cheque?

715
01:10:14,985 --> 01:10:17,696
Who goes to parties with chequebooks?

716
01:10:19,948 --> 01:10:22,283
What are you upto?

717
01:10:22,575 --> 01:10:23,702
Whose chequebook is that?

718
01:10:23,994 --> 01:10:25,954
Even for over-acting, this is too loud!

719
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:31,459
Five hundred thousand?
Have you gone mad?

720
01:10:33,545 --> 01:10:34,921
Thank you, sir.
- All the best.

721
01:10:37,924 --> 01:10:38,675
I'm finished.

722
01:10:42,971 --> 01:10:44,597
I could kill you.

723
01:10:45,223 --> 01:10:46,891
Our leading model, Sonal.

724
01:10:47,100 --> 01:10:48,268
How do you do?
- I'm very good.

725
01:10:48,476 --> 01:10:52,230
Kalpana has told us so much about you...
- We all know that... there're others...

726
01:10:52,439 --> 01:10:56,818
That article of yours in Economic Times.
- Not again, sir. Please...

727
01:11:04,659 --> 01:11:06,995
You... for Sanjay Singhania!

728
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:08,913
And they fell for you?

729
01:11:12,667 --> 01:11:16,921
Am I'm too clever,
or it's a world of fools?

730
01:11:32,812 --> 01:11:33,563
I love you.

731
01:11:35,148 --> 01:11:35,649
What?

732
01:11:38,735 --> 01:11:42,822
I love you.
I want to marry you.

733
01:11:46,701 --> 01:11:49,371
What... so all of a sudden...?

734
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:52,999
Not so... all of a sudden.

735
01:11:56,836 --> 01:12:00,048
I never thought...

736
01:12:05,178 --> 01:12:06,554
Give me time, to think.

737
01:12:08,181 --> 01:12:10,141
Shall I tell you tomorrow?

738
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:19,776
If I say no, you won't take it badly?

739
01:12:32,706 --> 01:12:33,206
Bye.

740
01:12:36,418 --> 01:12:37,335
Happy new year.

741
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:39,754
Happy new year.

742
01:12:53,518 --> 01:12:55,353
To her, I'm just an ordinary guy.

743
01:12:56,771 --> 01:12:58,023
I wish to remain this unexceptional man...

744
01:12:58,231 --> 01:12:59,607
who wins her love.

745
01:13:02,152 --> 01:13:04,487
So I haven't told her the truth about me.

746
01:13:07,115 --> 01:13:09,034
If she accepts me,

747
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:13,580
then I'll confess to being Sanjay Singhania.

748
01:13:15,832 --> 01:13:17,375
If she refuses,

749
01:13:19,044 --> 01:13:19,711
then I remain Sachin...

750
01:13:19,919 --> 01:13:23,381
and I fade out of her life.

751
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:27,469
All I await now, is tomorrow.

752
01:13:38,688 --> 01:13:40,649
End of the diary.
December 31st.

753
01:13:41,483 --> 01:13:45,612
Next day, next year... 2006.

754
01:13:54,537 --> 01:13:56,915
Hey... hey...

755
01:13:57,248 --> 01:13:58,291
The next day, what happened...?

756
01:13:58,583 --> 01:14:00,960
What did she say...
what happened to her?

757
01:14:01,169 --> 01:14:02,671
How did you end up like this?

758
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:05,423
Speak up!

759
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:04,376
Hello, sir.

760
01:16:04,959 --> 01:16:05,919
I'm your manager.

761
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:07,629
Pankaj Shroff.

762
01:16:12,884 --> 01:16:13,760
Hello Sanjay.

763
01:16:13,969 --> 01:16:16,304
I'm your doctor. Dr Peston Wadia.

764
01:16:17,764 --> 01:16:19,265
Not enough sleep.

765
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:21,810
Are up keeping up till late?

766
01:16:21,977 --> 01:16:25,438
Sir, I'm telling you again,

767
01:16:25,647 --> 01:16:28,608
it's fine if you won't go to the office,
it's okay, no problem.

768
01:16:28,817 --> 01:16:32,862
But live in your mansion,
why this tiny flat?

769
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:38,076
We can get a nurse, a chauffeur here...?

770
01:16:38,910 --> 01:16:40,328
I need no one.

771
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:43,790
Thank you.

772
01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:49,838
Kill Ghajini.
Check invitation on Calendar.

773

775
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:11,401
Sir... you're... here...
for our college culture fest?

776
01:17:14,279 --> 01:17:15,780
Oh, I'm sorry.

777
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:19,576
You won't know me...
I mean, you know me.

778
01:17:19,826 --> 01:17:20,869
I've met you.

779
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:24,998
Sanjay Singhania...
short term memory loss.

780
01:17:25,498 --> 01:17:26,291
Come on, it's nearly time.

781
01:17:26,499 --> 01:17:27,500
One minute...

782
01:17:27,751 --> 01:17:29,127
We're getting late.
Sunita, let's go.

783
01:17:29,336 --> 01:17:32,088
Don't leave before my performance
...second song.

784
01:17:41,431 --> 01:17:46,144
Girls and boys... please
...calm down.

785
01:17:46,353 --> 01:17:52,859
Our chief guest for the
evening has arrived.

786
01:17:53,401 --> 01:17:57,656
He has patronised our college for long.

787
01:17:57,989 --> 01:18:01,534
I'd like you to give him
a hearty welcome.

788
01:18:01,951 --> 01:18:02,994
Boys and girls,

789
01:18:03,203 --> 01:18:05,830
please welcome Mr. Ghajini Dharmatma.

790
01:19:15,650 --> 01:19:17,277
Crazy, crazy!

791
01:19:17,485 --> 01:19:19,362
I'm crazy about him

792
01:19:27,996 --> 01:19:29,622
Why's my body going crazy?

793
01:19:30,081 --> 01:19:31,916
Why's my heart beating crazy?

794
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:34,044
I want to dance,

795
01:19:34,336 --> 01:19:36,296
uninhibited

796
01:19:36,546 --> 01:19:40,634
Who's come into my heart today?
What's this scent of love?

797
01:19:40,842 --> 01:19:43,720
Dancing bells are on my feet,
it's my season of youth

798
01:19:48,683 --> 01:19:49,726
Hello

799
01:19:54,773 --> 01:19:56,024
Crazy,

800
01:19:56,191 --> 01:19:58,193
I'm crazy for him!

801
01:20:02,364 --> 01:20:04,407
He's my love

802
01:20:11,706 --> 01:20:17,337
His coming has filled the
emptinesses in my heart

803
01:20:17,629 --> 01:20:21,091
He only has to make a sign
and I'll become his slave

804
01:20:43,626 --> 01:20:45,961
Go outside, find out who's calling.

805
01:20:52,843 --> 01:20:53,385
Hello?

806
01:20:54,261 --> 01:20:55,721
Get down to the basement car park.

807
01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:56,513
What...?

808
01:21:15,866 --> 01:21:16,700
Who's that?

809
01:21:18,869 --> 01:21:19,912
What are you doing there?

810
01:21:25,334 --> 01:21:25,960
Damn you!

811
01:22:28,689 --> 01:22:29,148
Hey...

812
01:22:30,357 --> 01:22:37,156
Hey...

813
01:22:50,544 --> 01:22:51,670
Who was that?

814
01:22:54,381 --> 01:22:56,133
Who tried to kill you?

815
01:22:56,926 --> 01:22:59,178
Not me...

816
01:23:02,139 --> 01:23:02,890
he came to kill you.

817
01:23:03,098 --> 01:23:03,724
Me...?

818
01:23:05,392 --> 01:23:07,811
Came to kill me?
Who was he?

819
01:23:08,729 --> 01:23:10,147
Who was it... who?

820
01:23:11,398 --> 01:23:13,025
Two years ago...

821
01:23:13,234 --> 01:23:15,903
Two years ago... what...?

822
01:23:17,655 --> 01:23:18,739
What was it two years ago?

823
01:23:20,032 --> 01:23:21,492
What...?

824
01:23:21,909 --> 01:23:23,619
Give me his name.

825
01:23:23,827 --> 01:23:24,954
The name!

826
01:23:25,162 --> 01:23:26,705
His name, who was he?

827
01:23:26,914 --> 01:23:29,291
Who wants to kill me?

828
01:23:30,709 --> 01:23:33,003
He's dead.

829
01:23:36,048 --> 01:23:36,882
Shit.

830
01:23:41,512 --> 01:23:46,892
Two years ago?
What did I do two years ago?

831
01:23:47,601 --> 01:23:51,021
Which jobs did I get done
two years ago?

832
01:23:52,481 --> 01:23:57,194
Which ones are after my life?

833
01:23:58,445 --> 01:24:01,699
A list... make a list of them all.

834
01:24:02,283 --> 01:24:05,953
I must have the list tomorrow.
You get it?

835
01:24:15,379 --> 01:24:16,380
Excuse me

836
01:24:17,381 --> 01:24:19,842
Where is Mr Sanjay Singhania's flat?

837
01:24:20,217 --> 01:24:21,552
Fourth floor. 401.

838
01:24:21,969 --> 01:24:22,720
Thanks

839
01:24:34,064 --> 01:24:34,857
Sir...

840
01:24:38,527 --> 01:24:39,403
Sir...?

841
01:24:49,204 --> 01:24:50,080
Sir...

842
01:25:13,354 --> 01:25:14,772
Kill him

843
01:25:16,523 --> 01:25:17,524
Revenge

844
01:25:18,025 --> 01:25:19,026
Ghajini?

845
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:20,694
She was murdered

846
01:25:23,530 --> 01:25:24,740
Find him Kill him

847
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:32,248
Done

848
01:25:35,751 --> 01:25:36,877
Over

849
01:25:37,086 --> 01:25:38,712
Ghajini 10 June 2008

850
01:25:49,431 --> 01:25:53,811
Doctor... restaurant... theatre...

851
01:26:15,457 --> 01:26:17,626
Don't open

852
01:26:22,172 --> 01:26:23,299
I'm a police officer.

853
01:26:23,507 --> 01:26:25,467
Untie me. I'm a police officer.

854
01:26:42,359 --> 01:26:45,487
Get out of here! Fast!
He's a murderer.

855
01:26:45,696 --> 01:26:47,656
Don't you hear?

856
01:26:47,865 --> 01:26:49,074
Just get the hell out of here!

857
01:27:05,674 --> 01:27:06,508
Who are you?

858
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:11,263
What are you doing here?

859
01:29:48,963 --> 01:29:50,089
The other shade.

860
01:30:05,437 --> 01:30:15,406
BIGPictures

861
01:30:19,702 --> 01:30:20,411
Shall we...?

862
01:30:23,330 --> 01:30:25,040
You've forgotten so quickly?

863
01:30:25,666 --> 01:30:27,042
I was buying nail polish.

864
01:30:29,253 --> 01:30:30,045
Look...

865
01:30:30,254 --> 01:30:33,549
My friend... you wrote that out.

866
01:30:34,341 --> 01:30:35,384
Now, come on.

867
01:30:49,690 --> 01:30:54,320
Have I been I chasing you?
- Why should you...? I'm your friend.

868
01:30:54,778 --> 01:30:56,614
No! I'm chasing you.

869
01:30:57,239 --> 01:30:59,241
I'm breathing hard,
you're out of breath.

870
01:30:59,450 --> 01:31:00,910
I'm sweating. Even you are...

871
01:31:01,785 --> 01:31:03,746
Hey! You're smoking in a public place!

872
01:31:04,038 --> 01:31:06,165
Have you no sense of decency?
Idiots.

873
01:31:06,373 --> 01:31:07,082
You're right!

874
01:31:07,291 --> 01:31:09,335
You ought to thrash some
sense into them.

875
01:31:09,543 --> 01:31:11,962
Go on, teach them such a
lesson that they'll quit smoking.

876
01:31:12,212 --> 01:31:13,756
Go... hit them.

877
01:31:14,798 --> 01:31:17,551
You'll teach us lessons?

878
01:31:17,843 --> 01:31:18,928
You're going to hit us?

879
01:31:19,136 --> 01:31:20,012
Come on.

880
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:22,389
You'll take on all of us?
Come on.

881
01:31:22,598 --> 01:31:24,266
Hit us.
- Come on.

882
01:31:51,835 --> 01:31:54,171
Ghajini... listen...

883
01:31:55,130 --> 01:31:56,882
don't do it.

884
01:31:57,091 --> 01:32:00,135
In four years,
we haven't had any quarrels.

885
01:32:00,552 --> 01:32:01,887
Why do you want to kill me?

886
01:32:02,096 --> 01:32:02,930
Who told you?

887
01:32:03,347 --> 01:32:06,267
I don't care if you want to kill me or not.

888
01:32:06,934 --> 01:32:10,229
I only want to finish off all my enemies.

889
01:32:11,772 --> 01:32:12,439
Shoot.

890
01:32:33,627 --> 01:32:35,170
Everyone's dead.

891
01:32:36,714 --> 01:32:37,798
Why are you still anxious?

892
01:32:39,508 --> 01:32:43,679
No... he's still alive.

893
01:32:44,847 --> 01:32:46,640
He wasn't anyone of them.

894
01:32:49,935 --> 01:32:52,688
These men were afraid of me.

895
01:32:53,898 --> 01:32:56,859
But this is someone else...

896
01:32:57,902 --> 01:32:59,820
someone I'm missing.

897
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:03,157
A girl is here, asking for you.

898
01:33:03,574 --> 01:33:04,408
What girl?

899
01:33:04,575 --> 01:33:08,078
My name is Sunita.
I am a medical student.

900
01:33:08,829 --> 01:33:11,498
I visited a patient
at his home, recently.

901
01:33:12,082 --> 01:33:14,793
He is planning to kill you.

902
01:33:16,378 --> 01:33:21,634
He has already killed two others.
I have seen photos of the dead men.

903
01:33:22,217 --> 01:33:26,388
He is an extremely dangerous man.
I saw him trying to kill a policeman.

904
01:33:26,597 --> 01:33:31,560
The policeman got killed in an accident.
After that he came after me, to kill me.

905
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,273
Look... your photo.

906
01:33:37,024 --> 01:33:38,317
A date is inscribed underneath.

907
01:33:40,569 --> 01:33:46,283
I was about to go to the police.
But if my college gets to know, I'm in a mess.

908
01:33:47,076 --> 01:33:49,662
I just couldn't sit on it,
so I came to you.

909
01:33:49,870 --> 01:33:51,288
To warn you.

910
01:33:52,790 --> 01:33:55,709
His photo...
the man who wants to kill you.

911
01:34:02,216 --> 01:34:05,678
Mr Sanjay Singhania. 31 years.
Short term memory loss

912
01:34:26,323 --> 01:34:28,492
Short term memory loss.

913
01:34:31,412 --> 01:34:37,668
A man who forgets everything in
fifteen minutes is planning to kill me.

914
01:34:39,253 --> 01:34:42,381
He even named a day for my death?

915
01:34:43,591 --> 01:34:46,302
I got to fix a time for him to die.

916
01:34:47,386 --> 01:34:52,182
12 hours. This man will be
on earth no more.

917
01:35:23,172 --> 01:35:23,881
The boss?

918
01:35:25,049 --> 01:35:26,133
Watch out.

919
01:35:26,717 --> 01:35:27,676
He's away from home.

920
01:35:28,177 --> 01:35:32,514
If he goes your way, you kill him.
If he comes this way, I'll kill the bastard.

921
01:35:32,765 --> 01:35:33,515
Sure.

922
01:36:33,993 --> 01:36:36,245
I'm into this problem...

923
01:36:36,412 --> 01:36:36,912
What...?

924
01:36:37,288 --> 01:36:38,872
He has my photo.

925
01:36:39,081 --> 01:36:41,542
Who has...?
- That Sanjay Singhania... he has it.

926
01:36:41,750 --> 01:36:43,168
Isn't it the one?

927
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:45,921
He has another one.
He had taken two photos.

928
01:36:46,130 --> 01:36:47,965
You're the problem.

929
01:36:48,257 --> 01:36:51,468
If it ends up with the police,
I'm in a fix.

930
01:36:52,052 --> 01:36:57,349
Ask Mr Ghajini. He's looking for that guy,
he'll get the photo for you.

931
01:37:15,159 --> 01:37:16,994
Hello, Mr Ghajini...?

932
01:37:18,662 --> 01:37:19,288
Hello...

933
01:37:23,918 --> 01:37:24,793
Mr Ghajini...?

934
01:37:26,503 --> 01:37:26,962
Yes

935
01:37:27,504 --> 01:37:29,298
I'm Sunita...

936
01:37:29,673 --> 01:37:33,344
I met you about Sanjay Singhania.

937
01:37:35,179 --> 01:37:35,721
Who...?

938
01:37:36,013 --> 01:37:37,431
Sanjay Singhania,

939
01:37:37,681 --> 01:37:39,475
the man who wants to kill you.

940
01:37:39,934 --> 01:37:42,353
The one with the 15-minute memory...

941
01:37:43,145 --> 01:37:47,650
He has a problem remembering,
but best to be cautious.

942
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:50,402
He's an extremely dangerous man.

943
01:37:50,611 --> 01:37:55,866
You see, he has a photo of mine.

944
01:37:56,533 --> 01:37:58,160
Do what you will to him,

945
01:37:58,410 --> 01:38:01,038
but get me my photo, please.

946
01:38:01,580 --> 01:38:04,375
He took my photo in the college canteen.

947
01:38:09,922 --> 01:38:11,298
What are you wearing in the photo?

948
01:38:11,507 --> 01:38:13,259
Blue top and blue jeans.

949
01:38:17,304 --> 01:38:19,223
Let me find it, I'll send it to you.

950
01:38:20,182 --> 01:38:21,183
What's your address?

951
01:40:04,745 --> 01:40:05,871
Warden...!

952
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:06,830
Hurry...

953
01:40:07,081 --> 01:40:09,833
Help me, please! Help me!

954
01:40:21,053 --> 01:40:21,929
Excuse me.

955
01:40:22,179 --> 01:40:22,888
Stay away.

956
01:40:23,097 --> 01:40:23,973
Where's the lift?

957
01:40:24,223 --> 01:40:25,349
Between second and third floors.

958
01:40:25,599 --> 01:40:26,600
Put on the main switch.

959
01:41:43,636 --> 01:41:44,762
His diaries.

960
01:42:26,554 --> 01:42:28,639
If she accepts me,

961
01:42:29,557 --> 01:42:32,142
then I'll confess to being Sanjay Singhania.

962
01:42:33,143 --> 01:42:34,812
If she refuses,

963
01:42:35,312 --> 01:42:37,314
then I remain Sachin...

964
01:42:37,523 --> 01:42:38,941
and I fade out of her life.

965
01:42:39,858 --> 01:42:41,819
All I await now, is tomorrow.

966
01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:14,059
This wait for a yes will keep me up tonight.

967
01:43:15,185 --> 01:43:17,646
This suspense is haunting,

968
01:43:17,897 --> 01:43:19,148
how can I sleep tonight?

969
01:43:20,190 --> 01:43:23,652
To what news my morning light will dawn,

970
01:43:24,862 --> 01:43:26,488
to melodies of love like rain?

971
01:43:27,239 --> 01:43:29,992
Or, is this thirst to go unquenched?

972
01:43:52,223 --> 01:43:55,184
Like a passion, unfulfilled

973
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:57,853
You hold me in an ecstasy, thrilled

974
01:43:58,062 --> 01:44:00,856
And now,

975
01:44:06,570 --> 01:44:08,030
the consummation,

976
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:09,365
of that ecstasy,

977
01:44:09,657 --> 01:44:11,700
in your arms,

978
01:44:11,951 --> 01:44:15,037
is all I wish from you

979
01:44:15,246 --> 01:44:17,873
In my heart of hearts, how I pine

980
01:44:18,123 --> 01:44:20,876
To splash you with my colours of life

981
01:44:21,126 --> 01:44:23,212
In every mood, to match my rhythm

982
01:44:23,462 --> 01:44:25,881
It's all I wish from you

983
01:44:26,632 --> 01:44:29,218
If only you say yes, then life...

984
01:44:29,426 --> 01:44:32,221
can spring forth from the fountainhead...

985
01:44:32,429 --> 01:44:37,560
to spew my pearls of life upon your path

986
01:44:41,522 --> 01:44:43,065
Consummation...

987
01:44:43,274 --> 01:44:44,400
of that ecstasy...

988
01:44:44,650 --> 01:44:46,068
in your arms...

989
01:44:46,277 --> 01:44:48,737
is all I wish

990
01:45:23,314 --> 01:45:25,774
My gossamer dreams are cast in glass

991
01:45:25,983 --> 01:45:28,611
As I ford my nights in dark

992
01:45:28,819 --> 01:45:33,949
Fearful, lest my fantasies shatter

993
01:45:34,491 --> 01:45:37,119
My hopes are inflamed

994
01:45:37,328 --> 01:45:39,955
Yet I fear, lest some tempest...

995
01:45:40,164 --> 01:45:45,294
puts out my flame

996
01:45:45,502 --> 01:45:50,966
I wait for a lone yes

997
01:45:51,175 --> 01:45:56,305
To turn on the springs ofjoy...

998
01:45:56,513 --> 01:45:59,642
in a culmination...

999
01:45:59,850 --> 01:46:02,311
of my dreams...

1000
01:46:02,519 --> 01:46:07,483
in the ecstasy of your embrace

1001
01:46:07,733 --> 01:46:11,320
It's all I wish

1002
01:46:33,717 --> 01:46:36,512
I have my Moon, over me my skies

1003
01:46:36,762 --> 01:46:39,348
Where dense dark clouds also hover

1004
01:46:39,557 --> 01:46:44,520
I wish this Moon is never overcast

1005
01:46:44,770 --> 01:46:47,690
A searing loneliness,

1006
01:46:47,898 --> 01:46:50,693
a pacing heart,

1007
01:46:50,901 --> 01:46:56,031
and not a moment's peace...

1008
01:46:56,240 --> 01:47:00,536
make up a wonderful story of mine;

1009
01:47:01,787 --> 01:47:07,209
I've only a restless yearning...

1010
01:47:07,418 --> 01:47:10,045
for a passion unfulfilled,

1011
01:47:10,254 --> 01:47:13,048
for an ecstasy, the thrill...

1012
01:47:13,257 --> 01:47:18,220
of your embrace

1013
01:47:18,429 --> 01:47:21,390
It's all I wish from you

1014
01:47:21,599 --> 01:47:24,393
In my heart of hearts, how I pine

1015
01:47:24,602 --> 01:47:27,229
To splash you with my colours of life

1016
01:47:27,438 --> 01:47:29,732
In every mood, to match my rhythm

1017
01:47:29,940 --> 01:47:32,902
It's all I wish from you

1018
01:47:33,110 --> 01:47:35,905
If only you say yes, then life...

1019
01:47:36,113 --> 01:47:38,741
can spring forth from the fountainhead...

1020
01:47:38,949 --> 01:47:44,079
to spew my pearls of life upon your path

1021
01:47:44,288 --> 01:47:48,083
For you, I thirst

1022
01:48:33,629 --> 01:48:35,339
All night, I kept thinking.

1023
01:48:36,674 --> 01:48:39,468
Until one o'clock it was, why you?

1024
01:48:40,594 --> 01:48:42,972
By two o'clock, it was why not?

1025
01:48:44,348 --> 01:48:45,766
At three am,

1026
01:48:46,016 --> 01:48:47,476
am I rushing into this?

1027
01:48:48,852 --> 01:48:51,814
At four, if not now then how will I ever...?

1028
01:48:52,523 --> 01:48:55,192
By the time it got to five o'c lock,
I had decided.

1029
01:48:56,735 --> 01:48:57,820
I do.

1030
01:49:05,369 --> 01:49:06,161
I love you.

1031
01:49:35,024 --> 01:49:36,901
Now's my turn to tell her who I am.

1032
01:49:37,109 --> 01:49:39,361
But you don't know who I am.

1033
01:49:40,070 --> 01:49:43,866
What...!
- When you get to know about my dad...

1034
01:49:44,033 --> 01:49:45,910
it'll blow your brains.

1035
01:49:46,076 --> 01:49:49,079
Is she talking my lines?

1036
01:49:50,039 --> 01:49:51,165
Take this.

1037
01:49:51,457 --> 01:49:56,545
In 1992, my dad had three Ambassador cars.

1038
01:49:58,088 --> 01:49:59,590
Oh wow...
- Oh yes.

1039
01:49:59,798 --> 01:50:02,176
He had a travel agency.
Shetty Travels.

1040
01:50:02,468 --> 01:50:05,429
Shitty Travels?
- Hey! Shetty... Travels.

1041
01:50:05,596 --> 01:50:07,765
Yes... I see... Shetty Travels.
- So.

1042
01:50:09,808 --> 01:50:11,810
It was my uncle who cheated him.

1043
01:50:12,019 --> 01:50:12,686
Ohh...

1044
01:50:13,437 --> 01:50:15,064
He stole all three cars.

1045
01:50:16,106 --> 01:50:18,234
Brokenhearted, my dad died.

1046
01:50:18,943 --> 01:50:20,694
That day, I swore...

1047
01:50:20,945 --> 01:50:23,864
until I buy three Ambassador cars,

1048
01:50:24,073 --> 01:50:25,824
I won't marry.

1049
01:50:27,034 --> 01:50:27,785
Three...?

1050
01:50:29,161 --> 01:50:30,579
Can't it climb down by a couple or so?

1051
01:50:31,497 --> 01:50:32,456
No way.

1052
01:50:33,624 --> 01:50:36,502
If you can wait, then wait.

1053
01:50:36,961 --> 01:50:37,711
Otherwise,

1054
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:39,964
marry a girl of your class.

1055
01:50:42,883 --> 01:50:43,926
I'll wait.

1056
01:50:44,718 --> 01:50:47,805
Don't worry.
Even after I'm rich,

1057
01:50:48,013 --> 01:50:51,433
I'll still be the same to you, like I'm now.

1058
01:50:52,142 --> 01:50:55,104
Promise?
- Promise.

1059
01:51:04,989 --> 01:51:05,990
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

1060
01:51:06,156 --> 01:51:07,950
A very happy new year to you.
- Thank you.

1061
01:51:08,409 --> 01:51:09,994
Mr Goenka has canceled for the day.

1062
01:51:10,828 --> 01:51:12,913
The board meeting is at eleven thirty.

1063
01:51:13,581 --> 01:51:15,874
The marketing presentation is post-lunch.

1064
01:51:16,083 --> 01:51:16,625
Okay.

1065
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:25,843
Sir... what did she say when
she got to know about you?

1066
01:51:28,470 --> 01:51:29,513
I haven't told her.

1067
01:51:31,098 --> 01:51:31,765
Why, sir?

1068
01:51:33,934 --> 01:51:34,894
Because, in 1992...

1069
01:51:35,102 --> 01:51:37,396
her dad had three Ambassador cars.

1070
01:51:37,855 --> 01:51:40,983
Her uncle tricked her dad out of the cars.

1071
01:51:41,901 --> 01:51:44,778
Now she wants to be richer than her uncle.

1072
01:51:45,487 --> 01:51:46,488
Until then, she won't marry.

1073
01:51:46,697 --> 01:51:48,532
What if you just told her...?

1074
01:51:48,699 --> 01:51:51,076
She'd want to be richer than me...

1075
01:51:51,535 --> 01:51:52,828
that'd be the end of my wedding.

1076
01:51:55,164 --> 01:51:59,835
Truth is, I prefer to keep up this facade.

1077
01:52:07,551 --> 01:52:09,303
I had bought this flat...
as my gift to her...

1078
01:52:10,554 --> 01:52:15,184
after telling her about me.
It's not to be,

1079
01:52:16,143 --> 01:52:17,853
but I got to give her the flat, somehow.

1080
01:52:18,562 --> 01:52:19,605
That's your responsibility.

1081
01:52:21,232 --> 01:52:22,107
It'll be done, sir.

1082
01:52:22,900 --> 01:52:23,525
Thanks.

1083
01:52:37,581 --> 01:52:38,832
May no one ever wish you ill.

1084
01:52:39,041 --> 01:52:40,709
And your tank forever be petrol-ful.

1085
01:52:55,099 --> 01:52:57,810
For me too... please.
- Quiet! There's enough for everyone.

1086
01:52:58,018 --> 01:53:00,563
For me, too?
- Late, even today?

1087
01:53:00,771 --> 01:53:02,273
You bought it?

1088
01:53:02,481 --> 01:53:04,191
Yes... surprise.

1089
01:53:04,441 --> 01:53:07,570
One in. Two more to go.
- Great!

1090
01:53:07,945 --> 01:53:10,197
I sold the jewellery meant
for my wedding.

1091
01:53:10,698 --> 01:53:12,199
Dear husband to-be,

1092
01:53:12,408 --> 01:53:13,867
I don't think, you care for a dowry.

1093
01:53:14,076 --> 01:53:15,244
So, I bought a car.

1094
01:53:15,786 --> 01:53:17,705
Sure... it moves?

1095
01:53:18,956 --> 01:53:21,375
Are you joking?
Take a test drive.

1096
01:53:22,793 --> 01:53:23,419
Come on, kids.

1097
01:53:30,885 --> 01:53:32,094
Smooth drive, isn't it?

1098
01:53:32,428 --> 01:53:33,137
Smooth roads.

1099
01:53:33,345 --> 01:53:34,179
Hey...?

1100
01:53:35,764 --> 01:53:37,099
Smooth as butter.

1101
01:53:38,684 --> 01:53:41,312
The radio, there's one in there.
It works!

1102
01:54:01,373 --> 01:54:04,919
Hey, this car is mine!
I just bought it.

1103
01:54:05,127 --> 01:54:09,048
Nice, isn't it?
- What a pretty car!

1104
01:54:30,527 --> 01:54:31,320
Good news, sir.

1105
01:54:31,612 --> 01:54:32,821
The fax is in from London.

1106
01:54:33,030 --> 01:54:34,156
We've got the licence.

1107
01:54:34,365 --> 01:54:36,867
All calls to UK will be routed through us.

1108
01:54:37,034 --> 01:54:38,118
That's wonderful!

1109
01:54:38,369 --> 01:54:39,495
Give the good news to the staff.

1110
01:54:39,703 --> 01:54:41,413
Sure. You must go to
London immediately.

1111
01:54:41,622 --> 01:54:42,289
Yes

1112
01:54:46,835 --> 01:54:47,836
Hi, how are you?

1113
01:54:48,045 --> 01:54:50,422
There's good news!

1114
01:54:50,631 --> 01:54:51,423
Strange!

1115
01:54:51,924 --> 01:54:55,094
She always pips me to the talking post?

1116
01:54:56,679 --> 01:54:57,763
Even I have something to tell you.

1117
01:54:57,972 --> 01:54:59,181
No. Me first.

1118
01:55:01,183 --> 01:55:01,850
Tell me.

1119
01:55:02,142 --> 01:55:05,896
I won a brand new flat in
an Air Voice lucky contest.

1120
01:55:06,897 --> 01:55:09,149
Air Voice lucky contest...?

1121
01:55:10,609 --> 01:55:14,238
Sir... that flat you wanted to give her...
I fixed a contest to do it.

1122
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:17,074
Wow, that's great! Congratulations.

1123
01:55:17,283 --> 01:55:19,076
Notjust congratulations.

1124
01:55:19,285 --> 01:55:20,911
Get over here in five minutes.

1125
01:55:21,495 --> 01:55:23,872
Kalpana, I'm a bit busy.
I can't come.

1126
01:55:24,081 --> 01:55:26,542
I'll hit you for pretending to be busy.

1127
01:55:27,126 --> 01:55:28,794
I'm giving you the address.
Come right away.

1128
01:55:41,140 --> 01:55:42,016
Hi!

1129
01:55:42,224 --> 01:55:44,393
Hi... congratulations.

1130
01:55:44,602 --> 01:55:45,603
Thank you

1131
01:55:47,271 --> 01:55:48,272
One second!

1132
01:55:52,735 --> 01:55:53,319
What's this?

1133
01:55:57,406 --> 01:55:58,949
You're taking your first step
into this home.

1134
01:55:59,158 --> 01:56:01,702
I want to capture it for posterity.

1135
01:56:05,956 --> 01:56:06,916
You too, come over.

1136
01:57:02,179 --> 01:57:02,972
Nice, isn't it?

1137
01:57:04,181 --> 01:57:04,890
Beautiful.

1138
01:57:05,099 --> 01:57:06,517
This is how it'll stay forever,

1139
01:57:06,684 --> 01:57:09,520
to remind us of the first step we took.

1140
01:57:20,489 --> 01:57:22,658
So! How is this home?

1141
01:57:24,034 --> 01:57:25,035
Fabulous!

1142
01:57:26,036 --> 01:57:28,789
New home, second hand car...

1143
01:57:28,872 --> 01:57:30,207
lucky strike?

1144
01:57:31,083 --> 01:57:32,543
I'm feeling so happy!

1145
01:57:32,876 --> 01:57:34,878
Weren't you saying something
on the phone?

1146
01:57:35,379 --> 01:57:41,343
Yes... I got to go out of town
for ten days.

1147
01:57:42,052 --> 01:57:42,970
Where to...?

1148
01:57:44,388 --> 01:57:45,347
My village.

1149
01:57:47,057 --> 01:57:49,143
Why, so suddenly?

1150
01:57:51,270 --> 01:57:53,022
My mother is sick.

1151
01:57:54,565 --> 01:57:55,983
Then, bring her here.

1152
01:57:56,859 --> 01:57:59,778
I got to go, I have some property there...

1153
01:57:59,987 --> 01:58:01,280
two acres of land.

1154
01:58:01,572 --> 01:58:02,573
I got to sell it...

1155
01:58:02,740 --> 01:58:04,366
for my mother's medical treatment.

1156
01:58:06,493 --> 01:58:11,582
Ten days?
You'll come sooner, if you can...?

1157
01:58:12,458 --> 01:58:13,125
I will.

1158
01:58:14,835 --> 01:58:16,211
You will come, won't you?

1159
01:58:17,338 --> 01:58:18,881
What's it, why are you nervous?

1160
01:58:20,007 --> 01:58:23,636
I don't know, it's just an odd feeling.

1161
01:58:23,844 --> 01:58:24,887
Hey...

1162
01:58:27,890 --> 01:58:29,225
Silly you.

1163
01:58:34,605 --> 01:58:36,148
All the rest are standard clauses.

1164
01:58:36,273 --> 01:58:37,983
I think we've covered everything, right?

1165
01:58:38,192 --> 01:58:40,069
Yes, we've clarified all the points.

1166
01:58:40,945 --> 01:58:44,240
I'll need a hard copy on the flight.

1167
01:58:44,448 --> 01:58:44,949
Will be done.

1168
01:58:45,115 --> 01:58:47,493
Make sure, all changes are incorporated.
- Right.

1169
01:58:47,701 --> 01:58:49,453
Yes...?
- Sir, we're getting late.

1170
01:58:50,537 --> 01:58:53,666
It's one o'clock!
All right, let's pack.

1171
01:58:55,292 --> 01:58:56,460
Thank you, gentlemen.

1172
01:59:02,967 --> 01:59:03,634
Hello?

1173
01:59:03,842 --> 01:59:06,595
Hello Sachin... Kalpana.
- Yes Kalpana?

1174
01:59:06,845 --> 01:59:08,180
I got to see you right away.

1175
01:59:08,973 --> 01:59:10,724
Come over to my old place.

1176
01:59:12,101 --> 01:59:14,853
It's one am. Say, what's the matter?

1177
01:59:15,521 --> 01:59:20,109
I got to see you before you leave.
Please.

1178
01:59:22,152 --> 01:59:23,445
All right. I'm coming.

1179
01:59:37,960 --> 01:59:39,128
Why are you standing on the street?

1180
01:59:39,545 --> 01:59:41,505
Just waiting, for you.

1181
01:59:47,595 --> 01:59:50,222
So... why did you call me?

1182
02:00:00,858 --> 02:00:01,692
What's this?

1183
02:00:02,693 --> 02:00:04,695
One hundred and thirty five thousand.

1184
02:00:05,070 --> 02:00:06,614
For your mother's treatment.

1185
02:00:09,450 --> 02:00:10,659
Where did you get so much money?

1186
02:00:11,744 --> 02:00:12,828
I sold my car.

1187
02:00:13,037 --> 02:00:14,914
What... why?

1188
02:00:16,582 --> 02:00:19,043
You would've sold the land.

1189
02:00:20,044 --> 02:00:22,922
Don't sell it. It's an inheritance.

1190
02:00:23,881 --> 02:00:26,008
A car... I can buy again.

1191
02:00:28,552 --> 02:00:29,178
But...

1192
02:00:31,680 --> 02:00:33,057
you wanted the car so much!

1193
02:00:33,390 --> 02:00:34,016
Forget it.

1194
02:00:34,225 --> 02:00:36,852
Show your mother my soap ad.

1195
02:00:37,102 --> 02:00:38,687
I'm looking nice in that one.

1196
02:00:44,401 --> 02:00:45,653
Come back quickly.

1197
02:00:47,404 --> 02:00:50,199
Next week, I'm in Goa for an ad shoot.

1198
02:00:50,658 --> 02:00:52,034
I'll be back in two or three days.

1199
02:00:52,785 --> 02:00:55,037
You're getting late... now go.

1200
02:01:00,084 --> 02:01:01,210
Go on.

1201
02:01:13,305 --> 02:01:23,274
BIGPictures

1202
02:01:58,559 --> 02:02:03,188
How was it that you came to me

1203
02:02:04,398 --> 02:02:08,193
How blessed I am,
but it's hard to believe

1204
02:02:08,402 --> 02:02:12,197
You descended upon
life's placid lake...

1205
02:02:12,406 --> 02:02:18,120
like a rare Moon,

1206
02:02:18,329 --> 02:02:20,956
slowly,

1207
02:02:21,165 --> 02:02:23,792
gently

1208
02:02:26,837 --> 02:02:30,466
Under a winter's Sun,

1209
02:02:30,674 --> 02:02:33,677
like a warm melody...

1210
02:02:34,094 --> 02:02:36,931
you have caressed me,

1211
02:02:37,139 --> 02:02:45,272
I am enthralled

1212
02:02:45,522 --> 02:02:51,487
In you, my peace.
You are my passion

1213
02:02:51,695 --> 02:02:57,284
Why didn't I find you before?

1214
02:02:57,576 --> 02:03:07,628
How was it that you came to me...
how blessed I am, but it's hard to believe

1215
02:03:09,296 --> 02:03:11,006
That day, I swore...

1216
02:03:11,382 --> 02:03:14,176
until I buy three Ambassador cars,

1217
02:03:14,385 --> 02:03:16,178
I won't marry.

1218
02:03:18,973 --> 02:03:21,809
Don't sell it.
It's an inheritance.

1219
02:03:22,726 --> 02:03:24,979
A car... I can buy again.

1220
02:03:31,235 --> 02:03:37,575
And once I believed,

1221
02:03:38,576 --> 02:03:41,203
that the Creator finds...

1222
02:03:41,412 --> 02:03:43,664
His urge no more

1223
02:03:44,415 --> 02:03:44,915
And then...

1224
02:03:45,082 --> 02:03:50,045
He created you

1225
02:03:50,379 --> 02:03:56,552
And now He is revealed to me...

1226
02:03:56,760 --> 02:04:01,724
in all His glory

1227
02:04:13,277 --> 02:04:17,907
Chords of a music touch my life,

1228
02:04:19,116 --> 02:04:23,078
I can feel new tunes coming into life

1229
02:04:23,287 --> 02:04:33,005
But I still can't believe...

1230
02:04:33,214 --> 02:04:35,633
how blessed I am,

1231
02:04:35,799 --> 02:04:38,594
how you came to me...

1232
02:05:00,574 --> 02:05:01,492
I love you.

1233
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:12,086
Come back quickly.

1234
02:05:46,245 --> 02:05:49,123
That's upto 21st June 2006.

1235
02:05:49,999 --> 02:05:53,377
Afterwards, Sanjay went to London
and Kalpana went to Goa.

1236
02:05:53,961 --> 02:05:55,170
What happened after that?

1237
02:06:16,150 --> 02:06:20,863
Anything more on the man
we arrested at the girls' hostel?

1238
02:06:21,071 --> 02:06:24,074
No, it's turning out to be a strange case.
- How come?

1239
02:06:26,869 --> 02:06:27,786
Bring him.

1240
02:06:28,329 --> 02:06:32,541
It was tough keeping him under control,
so he was given a sedative.

1241
02:06:37,588 --> 02:06:40,591
He has several names
and numbers tattooed.

1242
02:06:40,758 --> 02:06:43,385
Also, several strange remarks.

1243
02:06:43,844 --> 02:06:44,553
On the head...

1244
02:06:44,887 --> 02:06:46,138
he has a deep scar.

1245
02:06:46,347 --> 02:06:47,056
Found on him...

1246
02:06:47,264 --> 02:06:50,392
a gun, a camera, photographs.

1247
02:06:50,726 --> 02:06:53,771
We haven't been able to
find out who he is.

1248
02:06:56,065 --> 02:06:58,817
Call up those numbers.
Find out who they are.

1249
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:15,626
Hello?

1250
02:07:16,877 --> 02:07:19,755
Constable Dhuri from
D.N. Nagar Police station.

1251
02:07:37,147 --> 02:07:39,483
Do you recognise this man?

1252
02:07:47,449 --> 02:07:48,158
Yes.

1253
02:07:48,659 --> 02:07:51,203
He is Sanjay Singhania,
chairman of Air Voice.

1254
02:07:51,412 --> 02:07:53,789
The chairman of Air Voice?
- Yes.

1255
02:07:54,748 --> 02:07:56,792
He suffers from short term memory loss,

1256
02:07:57,001 --> 02:08:00,629
doesn't remember anything
beyond 15 minutes.

1257
02:08:01,338 --> 02:08:02,464
A friend of mine,

1258
02:08:03,340 --> 02:08:08,137
he has tattooed in my name and
number, for remembering me.

1259
02:08:10,681 --> 02:08:11,640
That's all.

1260
02:08:12,558 --> 02:08:13,684
Where did you find him?

1261
02:08:14,018 --> 02:08:17,479
Medical college girl's hostel. In a lift.

1262
02:08:17,938 --> 02:08:20,232
Sir, his manager and
his secretary are here.

1263
02:08:20,691 --> 02:08:23,360
Have you written a complaint about him?
- Not yet, sir.

1264
02:08:24,695 --> 02:08:25,654
Wait a while.

1265
02:08:25,946 --> 02:08:27,156
He's only a patient.

1266
02:08:27,907 --> 02:08:29,491
And do you know who he is?

1267
02:08:30,117 --> 02:08:32,244
He was found in a girls' hostel
with a gun.

1268
02:08:32,453 --> 02:08:34,038
How is one to take him
for a medical patient?

1269
02:08:34,246 --> 02:08:36,332
The gun is for his safety.

1270
02:08:37,291 --> 02:08:38,667
Here's the gun licence.

1271
02:08:39,960 --> 02:08:41,670
He didn't shoot at anyone, did he?

1272
02:08:43,422 --> 02:08:45,007
No complaint has been registered.

1273
02:08:45,299 --> 02:08:46,675
You can take him away.

1274
02:08:47,218 --> 02:08:49,511
But from now on, be careful.

1275
02:08:49,887 --> 02:08:52,056
Please take their contact details.

1276
02:08:52,598 --> 02:08:54,350
Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

1277
02:08:54,516 --> 02:08:55,517
Careful.

1278
02:09:33,013 --> 02:09:34,390
Sorry, you aren't allowed...
- Who are you?

1279
02:09:34,598 --> 02:09:36,600
Move over.
- Whom do you want?

1280
02:09:36,809 --> 02:09:37,893
Silence!

1281
02:09:38,102 --> 02:09:39,395
Why are you locking us?

1282
02:09:42,815 --> 02:09:47,444
171, Cheetah Camp. Deonar

1283
02:09:47,987 --> 02:09:50,447
13.06.2008

1284
02:09:51,115 --> 02:09:52,032
Whose address is it?

1285
02:09:52,241 --> 02:09:53,409
Mine.

1286
02:09:54,118 --> 02:09:57,997
The date is tomorrow's.
One day on, you'd be gone.

1287
02:09:59,331 --> 02:10:00,875
Don't shoot him!

1288
02:10:02,501 --> 02:10:06,005
My name and number are on his body.

1289
02:10:06,839 --> 02:10:08,799
In police records,
he's a friend of mine.

1290
02:10:09,383 --> 02:10:13,596
A murder enquiry can
become big trouble.

1291
02:10:13,804 --> 02:10:17,057
You mean, we leave him alive?
- Yes, alive.

1292
02:10:18,392 --> 02:10:19,935
But like the living dead.

1293
02:10:20,644 --> 02:10:23,939
He's got memory tags everywhere.

1294
02:10:24,815 --> 02:10:27,151
We've got to erase what he has written,

1295
02:10:28,485 --> 02:10:31,780
we got to turn him into blank paper.

1296
02:11:40,558 --> 02:11:44,186
Now, he's just like any other furniture

1297
02:11:45,271 --> 02:11:47,314
Just like a vegetable.

1298
02:12:03,205 --> 02:12:05,708
Newspaper archives?
- First floor.

1299
02:13:49,061 --> 02:13:50,688
Why are you hiding?

1300
02:13:51,188 --> 02:13:52,231
Come out.

1301
02:13:53,232 --> 02:13:56,694
Come... careful.

1302
02:13:58,028 --> 02:13:58,821
Sit.

1303
02:14:00,531 --> 02:14:01,574
What happened to you?

1304
02:14:02,283 --> 02:14:04,994
I'm from Latur village.

1305
02:14:05,202 --> 02:14:10,666
Ramesh brought me to Mumbai,
saying he'd find a job for me.

1306
02:14:10,875 --> 02:14:14,753
But he sold me to someone.

1307
02:14:15,880 --> 02:14:21,510
Now... he's forcing me to go to Goa.

1308
02:14:22,052 --> 02:14:26,849
And... there are more girls like me
in a bogey up ahead.

1309
02:14:27,057 --> 02:14:31,896
At one of the stations, I managed to
get away and I'm hiding here.

1310
02:14:32,396 --> 02:14:35,691
Don't cry. Nothing is going to happen.
I'm here with you.

1311
02:14:41,155 --> 02:14:42,031
She must be around.

1312
02:14:42,364 --> 02:14:43,490
Hurry up.

1313
02:14:44,283 --> 02:14:44,867
Move in.

1314
02:14:46,827 --> 02:14:47,536
Look behind.

1315
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,961
Did you see a girl, wearing a frock?

1316
02:14:56,420 --> 02:14:57,504
Give me ten Rupees.

1317
02:14:59,089 --> 02:14:59,882
Here.

1318
02:15:04,261 --> 02:15:08,057
Open the door.
- Open up!

1319
02:15:08,265 --> 02:15:09,475
Give that girl to me!

1320
02:15:10,100 --> 02:15:11,727
I paid 2000 Rupees to buy her!

1321
02:15:11,936 --> 02:15:13,312
Come on, open up!

1322
02:15:13,520 --> 02:15:15,231
Open the door!

1323
02:15:19,443 --> 02:15:21,320
Open it!

1324
02:15:25,699 --> 02:15:26,992
It's gold!

1325
02:15:27,451 --> 02:15:28,619
Should be worth 3,000.

1326
02:15:29,745 --> 02:15:31,539
Forget the girl. Let's go.

1327
02:15:33,791 --> 02:15:34,792
It's all right.

1328
02:15:59,316 --> 02:16:00,276
Don't be afraid.

1329
02:16:00,484 --> 02:16:02,820
We'll get down at the next station
and we'll go to Bombay.

1330
02:16:11,829 --> 02:16:14,248
We've been after chickens.

1331
02:16:14,874 --> 02:16:16,667
Will we spare a hen if we find one?

1332
02:16:20,254 --> 02:16:22,965
Let go... leave her!

1333
02:16:24,717 --> 02:16:26,552
Sister...

1334
02:16:28,679 --> 02:16:31,223
Help me!

1335
02:16:31,432 --> 02:16:31,682
Leave me!

1336
02:16:31,891 --> 02:16:33,350
How far can she run?

1337
02:16:33,684 --> 02:16:36,520
Sister, do something!

1338
02:16:36,729 --> 02:16:38,564
Look at her... there.

1339
02:16:38,772 --> 02:16:43,319
Sister! Help me!

1340
02:17:49,468 --> 02:17:50,970
Hi, how are you?

1341
02:17:51,178 --> 02:17:53,055
I'm okay. Are you in Goa?

1342
02:17:53,430 --> 02:17:55,474
No, I'm returning to Mumbai.

1343
02:17:55,683 --> 02:17:56,350
What?

1344
02:17:56,559 --> 02:17:58,185
It's a long story.

1345
02:17:58,394 --> 02:18:02,231
In my train, there were some goons.
They were taking 25 kidnapped girls to Goa.

1346
02:18:02,815 --> 02:18:04,275
Somehow, I managed to save them.

1347
02:18:04,441 --> 02:18:06,944
I'm on my way back
to Mumbai with them.

1348
02:18:07,278 --> 02:18:09,405
What! Are you all right?

1349
02:18:09,613 --> 02:18:10,906
Tell me about it, what happened?

1350
02:18:11,282 --> 02:18:12,908
Don't worry, nothing's happened to me.

1351
02:18:13,117 --> 02:18:14,076
Are you sure?

1352
02:18:14,285 --> 02:18:17,288
I'm perfectly all right, really.

1353
02:18:17,997 --> 02:18:19,290
You're too much, Kalpana.

1354
02:18:21,625 --> 02:18:24,169
But it's also what I like the
most about you.

1355
02:18:24,628 --> 02:18:25,713
What...?

1356
02:18:25,921 --> 02:18:27,298
This habit of helping others.

1357
02:18:28,007 --> 02:18:29,758
The first time I saw you,

1358
02:18:29,967 --> 02:18:34,555
you were helping some
disabled girls across a ditch.

1359
02:18:35,806 --> 02:18:36,974
How do you know that?

1360
02:18:38,642 --> 02:18:40,853
There's so much I haven't told you.

1361
02:18:41,770 --> 02:18:43,230
Stuff you'll be amazed to hear.

1362
02:18:43,480 --> 02:18:45,608
Drop the melodrama and tell me.

1363
02:18:46,191 --> 02:18:49,236
Not like this...
when I'm saying it,

1364
02:18:49,445 --> 02:18:51,280
I got to see the look on your face.

1365
02:18:52,197 --> 02:18:53,657
So, I'll tell it to you once I'm back.

1366
02:18:53,991 --> 02:18:54,992
See you.

1367
02:18:55,159 --> 02:18:56,201
Take care, bye.

1368
02:18:57,369 --> 02:18:58,245
Bye.

1369
02:19:09,715 --> 02:19:14,803
The biggest news is about kidnapped girls,
trafficking in human organs and flesh trade.

1370
02:19:15,012 --> 02:19:18,390
Last night's revelation has
stunned everyone.

1371
02:19:18,599 --> 02:19:22,978
25 girls from villages in North India lured to
the city on the pretext of giving jobs...

1372
02:19:23,187 --> 02:19:28,776
were being taken from Mumbai to Goa.
With the help of some soldiers,

1373
02:19:29,068 --> 02:19:30,903
Kalpana rescued them.

1374
02:19:31,070 --> 02:19:35,366
Investigations reveal that organs have already
been harvested from these girls.

1375
02:19:35,574 --> 02:19:39,411
Several girls have been operated surgically
and their kidneys have been removed.

1376
02:19:39,620 --> 02:19:44,917
Now they were en route to Goa,
to be pressed into the flesh trade.

1377
02:19:45,251 --> 02:19:48,963
It's apparently a full-fledged racket,
flourishing right across the country.

1378
02:19:49,171 --> 02:19:53,926
Investigations indicate the possible
involvement of influential people.

1379
02:19:54,260 --> 02:19:57,012
Information given by the rescued girls has
led to a country-wide crackdown.

1380
02:19:57,221 --> 02:20:01,225
Several suspects are
being questioned.

1381
02:20:01,433 --> 02:20:07,273
Most of them are women and young girls,
more than half of whom are children.

1382
02:20:18,242 --> 02:20:19,118
Hello

1383
02:20:19,201 --> 02:20:22,872
I'm Constable Vyjayanti.
From Bombay Municipal Hospital.

1384
02:20:23,080 --> 02:20:25,291
Yes, go on.

1385
02:20:25,416 --> 02:20:29,670
Look, you sent 25 girls...?
- Yes?

1386
02:20:29,879 --> 02:20:34,049
Two are missing, without a trace.

1387
02:20:34,592 --> 02:20:36,510
Please come over here
and check them out.

1388
02:20:37,052 --> 02:20:39,722
Please do not mention
that I've tipped you.

1389
02:20:39,930 --> 02:20:42,057
Some very influential people
are behind it.

1390
02:20:57,781 --> 02:20:59,867
Madam... here...?
At this hour?

1391
02:21:00,075 --> 02:21:01,076
Please come in the morning.

1392
02:21:01,285 --> 02:21:03,287
The girls will be let off tomorrow morning.

1393
02:21:03,495 --> 02:21:04,997
I had brought 25 girls.

1394
02:21:05,206 --> 02:21:06,332
There are only 23 here.

1395
02:21:06,540 --> 02:21:08,167
Where are the two girls?

1396
02:21:08,792 --> 02:21:10,336
You are mistaken.

1397
02:21:10,544 --> 02:21:11,795
You brought 23.

1398
02:21:12,004 --> 02:21:13,589
Don't you lie!

1399
02:21:13,714 --> 02:21:16,258
I have a list, of names.

1400
02:21:27,561 --> 02:21:28,479
Good evening, sir.

1401
02:21:32,024 --> 02:21:33,484
Yes.

1402
02:21:33,692 --> 02:21:35,694
You brought in 25 girls.

1403
02:21:36,528 --> 02:21:37,112
Who are you?

1404
02:21:37,321 --> 02:21:38,405
Ghajini.

1405
02:21:38,822 --> 02:21:40,157
Ghajini Dharmatma.

1406
02:21:41,533 --> 02:21:46,789
23 out of 25 named my men.
I'd let it pass.

1407
02:21:47,540 --> 02:21:50,793
But these two, pointed fingers at me.

1408
02:21:52,670 --> 02:21:54,338
Where are the two girls?

1409
02:21:54,588 --> 02:21:57,258
Dead and dumped in the sea.

1410
02:21:59,468 --> 02:22:01,554
Are you asking to know more?

1411
02:22:06,350 --> 02:22:08,269
Because of beasts like you,

1412
02:22:08,477 --> 02:22:10,813
girls are afraid to step out
of their homes.

1413
02:22:15,401 --> 02:22:18,153
Of how many apparitions of men,
should women beware?

1414
02:22:19,405 --> 02:22:21,407
Of keepers of faith and religion?

1415
02:22:22,199 --> 02:22:23,158
Of doctors?

1416
02:22:23,826 --> 02:22:26,871
At work places, in schools, colleges?

1417
02:22:43,095 --> 02:22:43,929
Hello

1418
02:23:04,325 --> 02:23:06,952
Dead and dumped in the sea.

1419
02:23:21,258 --> 02:23:21,759
Hello?

1420
02:23:21,926 --> 02:23:24,970
Vyjayanti speaking...

1421
02:23:25,179 --> 02:23:26,180
Go on.

1422
02:23:26,388 --> 02:23:29,141
They're planning to kill you.

1423
02:23:31,310 --> 02:23:33,229
Please do not go home.

1424
02:23:33,687 --> 02:23:34,897
Go elsewhere.

1425
02:23:35,606 --> 02:23:37,107
They're hiding inside your house.

1426
02:24:12,810 --> 02:24:16,313
What happened?
- A power failure... hold it.

1427
02:24:34,456 --> 02:24:36,917
The door is locked from inside.
She's in here.

1428
02:24:40,337 --> 02:24:41,380
Find her.

1429
02:25:51,242 --> 02:25:52,243
Kalpana...?

1430
02:26:00,584 --> 02:26:01,710
Kalpana

1431
02:26:30,906 --> 02:26:31,865
Kalpana

1432
02:26:47,965 --> 02:26:50,676
Don't go away... don't!

1433
02:27:19,788 --> 02:27:20,414
Fast.

1434
02:27:57,201 --> 02:27:57,785
Hey!

1435
02:27:59,537 --> 02:28:00,329
Look!

1436
02:28:05,376 --> 02:28:06,502
What's it?

1437
02:28:06,877 --> 02:28:08,212
She must've gone that way.

1438
02:28:08,420 --> 02:28:09,296
Go.

1439
02:28:55,009 --> 02:28:55,551
Hello?

1440
02:28:55,759 --> 02:28:57,803
Hello Kalpana... Kalpana...

1441
02:29:32,296 --> 02:29:33,297
Kalpana

1442
02:29:39,136 --> 02:29:40,137
Kalpana

1444
02:30:05,663 --> 02:30:06,664
Go away, Sachin.

1445
02:30:09,124 --> 02:30:09,542
Get out.

1446
02:30:09,750 --> 02:30:11,168
Kalpana... what...?

1447
02:30:14,171 --> 02:30:15,381
What happened...?

1448
02:30:21,512 --> 02:30:22,471
Ghajini

1449
02:30:28,185 --> 02:30:29,311
Ghajini

1450
02:30:43,701 --> 02:30:44,702
Kalpana!

1451
02:30:45,202 --> 02:30:46,036
Kalpana...

1452
02:31:40,591 --> 02:31:41,675
Kalpana

1453
02:32:13,582 --> 02:32:15,167
No!

1454
02:33:59,355 --> 02:34:03,525
I'm Sunita. I'm a medical student.

1455
02:35:45,586 --> 02:35:46,712
Forgive me.

1456
02:35:46,921 --> 02:35:48,672
Even I'm responsible for
the state you're in.

1457
02:35:48,881 --> 02:35:50,925
I'll take you to Ghajini.

1458
02:35:51,133 --> 02:35:52,468
I'll bring back your memories.

1459
02:35:52,676 --> 02:35:54,970
I got to talk to him! Now!

1460
02:36:02,019 --> 02:36:04,313
Hello... hello?

1461
02:36:04,521 --> 02:36:06,315
My name is Sanjay.

1462
02:36:06,732 --> 02:36:07,483
What?

1463
02:36:07,900 --> 02:36:09,526
Sanjay Singhania.

1464
02:36:10,569 --> 02:36:12,196
Your name is Ghajini.

1465
02:36:13,822 --> 02:36:16,075
Do you remember the first of July, 2006?

1466
02:36:17,660 --> 02:36:20,829
You may forget, but I cannot forget.

1467
02:36:21,539 --> 02:36:23,082
It's the only thing I remember.

1468
02:36:24,458 --> 02:36:27,044
Leaving you alive was a mistake.

1469
02:36:27,878 --> 02:36:32,341
But now, I'll finish you off.

1470
02:36:32,550 --> 02:36:34,260
This time, no sparing you.

1471
02:36:34,468 --> 02:36:37,429
Wait for your death. I'm coming.

1472
02:36:38,681 --> 02:36:40,182
Damn you!

1473
02:36:42,017 --> 02:36:47,731
Damn... a short-term memory-loss
patient is reminding me?

1474
02:36:50,943 --> 02:36:54,405
Get the cars.
We're going into my den.

1475
02:36:54,905 --> 02:36:56,532
Let him come to my area.

1476
02:36:58,200 --> 02:37:00,536
After I'm through,

1477
02:37:01,245 --> 02:37:03,455
they won't find even a fingernail on him.

1478
02:37:18,637 --> 02:37:19,889
They're going somewhere.

1479
02:37:20,389 --> 02:37:21,348
Follow them.

1480
02:38:01,555 --> 02:38:02,890
They're stopping here.

1481
02:38:03,098 --> 02:38:04,516
Which one is Ghajini?

1482
02:38:05,851 --> 02:38:07,311
The man in white.

1483
02:38:19,823 --> 02:38:21,617
This looks like a dangerous area.

1484
02:38:21,825 --> 02:38:23,661
I think we shouldn't wait here.

1485
02:38:28,123 --> 02:38:29,542
Where are you going?

1486
02:38:29,542 --> 02:38:30,626
You can't kill him so easily.

1487
02:38:30,834 --> 02:38:32,086
There are too many of them in there.

1488
02:38:32,294 --> 02:38:34,129
Stop! We'll get him when he's alone.

1489
02:38:34,338 --> 02:38:35,464
This is a very dangerous area.

1490
02:38:35,673 --> 02:38:37,049
Have you gone mad?

1491
02:38:41,011 --> 02:38:41,804
Oh God!

1492
02:38:58,195 --> 02:39:07,204
Hey stop... Where are you going?
Entry is barred

1493
02:39:55,878 --> 02:39:57,504
He's here! Tell the boss.

1494
02:40:12,144 --> 02:40:13,187
He's coming!

1495
02:40:14,271 --> 02:40:15,231
Move it...

1496
02:40:15,439 --> 02:40:16,815
let's get him!

1497
02:40:17,024 --> 02:40:19,360
Don't let him get away!
- Get the irons...

1498
02:40:19,568 --> 02:40:20,986
He won't get away!
- Don't let him in.

1499
02:41:56,165 --> 02:41:57,666
Boss...

1500
02:42:18,479 --> 02:42:22,983
Now you're gone... finished!

1501
02:48:13,250 --> 02:48:14,043
Brother...

1502
02:48:14,585 --> 02:48:17,087
help me... save me!

1503
02:48:17,421 --> 02:48:19,590
Ghajini is coming... that way!

1504
02:48:19,798 --> 02:48:20,841
Please, help me!

1505
02:48:21,425 --> 02:48:22,551
I'm Prakash!

1506
02:48:22,760 --> 02:48:23,594
Have you forgotten?

1507
02:48:23,761 --> 02:48:25,095
We came for Ghajini!

1508
02:48:25,304 --> 02:48:26,555
Look at how badly he has bruised me!

1509
02:48:26,764 --> 02:48:29,808
I'm Prakash...
Ghajini did this to me.

1510
02:48:31,101 --> 02:48:32,102
He hit me so badly.

1511
02:48:32,269 --> 02:48:34,063
He's a very dangerous man!

1512
02:48:34,939 --> 02:48:36,482
Very dangerous!

1513
02:48:36,732 --> 02:48:37,942
He's coming that way.

1514
02:48:38,609 --> 02:48:40,027
Keep an eye out for him.

1515
02:48:40,986 --> 02:48:42,154
Keep an eye on him.

1516
02:48:42,738 --> 02:48:43,447
Watch out

1517
02:48:44,281 --> 02:48:47,910
Cunning man... very cunning man.

1518
02:48:54,291 --> 02:48:55,918
Got you!

1519
02:49:19,441 --> 02:49:20,609
Got you!

1520
02:49:21,151 --> 02:49:23,404
Short term memory loss...

1521
02:49:24,822 --> 02:49:26,991
Look at my face.

1522
02:49:27,825 --> 02:49:29,076
Look.

1523
02:49:29,159 --> 02:49:30,953
I am Ghajini.

1524
02:49:31,328 --> 02:49:32,288
I am.

1525
02:49:32,830 --> 02:49:35,624
I am the one you wanted to kill.

1526
02:49:35,833 --> 02:49:36,959
Do you remember why?

1527
02:49:44,091 --> 02:49:46,468
Your memory is too weak,

1528
02:49:47,219 --> 02:49:49,305
lasts you forjust 15 minutes.

1529
02:49:50,097 --> 02:49:51,140
But have no regrets.

1530
02:49:53,058 --> 02:50:00,441
In these final 15 minutes of your life,
I'll give the action replay, over again.

1531
02:50:11,785 --> 02:50:13,204
Remember the rod...?

1532
02:50:14,622 --> 02:50:17,208
The one that I used to kill your fiancee?

1533
02:50:19,210 --> 02:50:20,419
Somewhat like this one...

1534
02:50:21,962 --> 02:50:23,172
it comes to your mind?

1535
02:50:29,053 --> 02:50:32,431
I killed her right in front of your eyes.

1536
02:50:39,521 --> 02:50:41,690
Before I kill you,

1537
02:50:41,899 --> 02:50:47,238
I'll show you exactly
how I killed your Kalpana.

1538
02:50:49,073 --> 02:50:49,949
Watch this.

1539
02:55:13,337 --> 02:55:15,047
Kalpana Home for Orphans

1540
02:55:41,323 --> 02:55:44,577
Let's go cut the cake.
- Yes... let's all go.

1541
02:55:48,622 --> 02:55:50,666
Time to cut your cake.

1542
02:55:52,293 --> 02:55:54,086
Wait!

1543
02:55:55,170 --> 02:55:57,506
Sanjay, what's her name?

1544
02:56:00,217 --> 02:56:01,385
Rahul... no.

1545
02:56:07,141 --> 02:56:08,017
Pooja.

1546
02:56:10,060 --> 02:56:11,437
You read it here!

1547
02:56:11,645 --> 02:56:13,606
Cheater... cheater...

1548
02:56:13,814 --> 02:56:26,035
Happy birthday to you.

1549
02:57:55,708 --> 02:58:05,676
BIGPictures

1550
02:58:10,639 --> 02:58:13,267
Pathways, streams and rivers all change

1551
02:58:13,475 --> 02:58:16,145
Glimmering lamps cast lights of change

1552
02:58:16,353 --> 02:58:19,148
When the change strikes life's rhythm

1553
02:58:19,356 --> 02:58:22,109
The rhythm of the rain will also change

1554
02:58:22,318 --> 02:58:27,656
And the nature of seasons will change

1555
02:58:28,240 --> 02:58:32,161
But I shall forever be...

1556
02:58:32,369 --> 02:58:36,165
the same to you as I've been

1557
02:58:36,373 --> 02:58:41,962
Arm in arm, with you my mate,

1558
02:58:42,171 --> 02:58:44,840
every moment,

1559
02:58:45,049 --> 02:58:47,092
always

1560
02:59:03,400 --> 02:59:07,863
How was it that you came to me

1561
02:59:09,240 --> 02:59:12,993
How blessed I was,
but it's hard to believe

1562
02:59:13,202 --> 02:59:16,997
You descended upon
life's placid lake...

1563
02:59:17,206 --> 02:59:22,878
like a rare Moon,

1564
02:59:23,087 --> 02:59:25,756
slowly,

1565
02:59:25,965 --> 02:59:28,217
gently

1566
02:59:31,679 --> 02:59:35,140
Under winter's Suns,

1567
02:59:35,349 --> 02:59:38,185
like a warm melody...

1568
02:59:38,769 --> 02:59:44,400
you caressed me, now you're gone

1569
02:59:44,775 --> 02:59:50,072
But I still live, enthralled

1570
02:59:50,531 --> 02:59:56,245
In you, my peace.
You are my passion

1571
02:59:56,453 --> 03:00:01,917
Why didn't I find you before?

1572
03:00:01,959 --> 03:00:12,553
How was it that you came to me...
how blessed I was, but it's hard to believe

1573
03:02:08,252 --> 03:02:14,550
And once I believed,

1574
03:02:15,634 --> 03:02:20,556
that the Creator finds
His urge no more

1575
03:02:21,390 --> 03:02:26,687
And then He created you...

1576
03:02:27,354 --> 03:02:32,902
for me to sing...

1577
03:02:33,110 --> 03:02:38,407
eulogies to His glory
