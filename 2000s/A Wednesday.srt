00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,594
Does a nything ever ha ppen to
our heroes in our films?

181
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,255
Sometimes it does.

182
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,458

192
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,991
Some kids from Sha nti na ga r
a re pla ying a pra nk on him.

193
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,157
Pa twa rdha n knows them.

00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,861
Ask him to stop them or else he
will be wa sting our time needlessly.

195
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,028
Right sir.

196
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,607
Sha mbu, who is responsible
for this incident?

197
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:28,174
I feel they did a good job by
putting up a n electric pole.

198
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,042
But they should not ha ve
dug this hole.

199
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:33,417
The government should think
twice before digging...

200
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:37,715
...tha t a common ma n like me
ca n fa II into this pothole.

201
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:40,117
Look a round! Toda y there

202
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:43,021
I mea n a re there potholes in the
city or this city is in potholes?

203
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,027
This government should ta ke
responsibility for these potholes.

204
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,967
So wha t do you feel? Why does
the government do such things?

205
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,199
The government likes to dig.

206
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:54,472
So this wa s Mr. Sha mbu a.k.a.
Electric ma n who...

207
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:56,699

Come ba ck a nd we'll ta lk.
- Yes.

223
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:17,473
The government should think
twice before digging...

224
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,009
...tha t a common ma n like me
ca n fa II into this pothole.

I mea n a re there potholes in the

227
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,213
This government should ta ke
responsibility for these potholes.

228
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,330
Sir, plea se forgive me.

00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:53,557
Too short to tra ce. But this is not

There is a lot of difference between

318
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:29,757
This is not a politica I ra lly.

There is a rea son for it.

323
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,436
If this ma n is telling
the truth then to stop him...

324
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:43,138
...we require a person with
unlimited a uthority.

325
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:45,048
There shouldn't be a ny
red ta pe or protocol.

326
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:47,813
He would need a bsolute
a nd complete freedom.

327
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:51,547
He should not be questioned
a bout a nything.

328
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,421
And I know tha t this is not
possible a nd tha t's why...

329
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:57,060
...I wa s running a wa y from
responsibility Sir.

330
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:01,565
Pa til, this opera tion will be
hea ded by Pra ka sh Ra thod.

331
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:05,061
I don't wa nt a ny compla ints
from him. Do you understa nd?

332
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:06,227
I'll be there soon.

333
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,472
Yes, sir. Should we
inform the center?

334
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:11,040
This is our problem a nd
we ha ve to solve it.

335
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:12,633
Oka y sir.

336

Mr. Roy won't be here. I will

340
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:29,390
How ca n he come there

00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,586

Who a re these guys?

344
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:41,036
You yourself ha d ca ught two of them.
And the ATS got the other two.

345
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:42,663
I hope it is not difficult.

346
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:45,503
Why would it be? We a re used to it.

347
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,501
First we put our lives a t

On whose beha If a re you doing this?

Wha t is the na me of
your orga niza tion?

354
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:09,099
Do you suspect tha t this
is a cra nk ca II? -

00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,558

He is extremely da ngerous.

484
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,921
Lqla k Ahmed. Al Qa eda a ga in.
Right ha nd of lbra him Kha n.

485
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:52,461
He is a former ISI a gent.
The theory is tha t...

486
00:38:52,596 --> 00:38:54,621
...when you ha d na bbed him
he wa nted to get ca ught.

487
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:56,960
So tha t it would be ea sy
to free lbra him Kha n.

488
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:59,468
He wa s directly or indirectly
involved in a II...

489
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:02,071
...the terrorists a tta cks in India
in the la st three yea rs.

490
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,572
He is equa lly da ngerous if not more.

491
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,613
Moha mma d Za heer. He is the number
2 a gent of La ska r in India.

492
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:12,511
He is a former ISI a s well
a s former Al Qa eda member.

493
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:14,373
He wa s a softwa re engineer.

494
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:16,645
Due to systema tic bra inwa shing
he went to Pa kista n.

495
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:17,811
From there he went to Afgha nista n.

496
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:18,979
He a cquired his tra ining over there.

497
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:20,988
He ha s designed a lot
of websites for them.

498
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:24,526
One of his websites is ca lled
www.india kita ba a hi.com

499
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:26,186
Very ba sic but very effective.

500
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,730
It registered record number
of hits the da y it opened.

501
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,960
He is in our C-Zone hospita I
since la st week.

502
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:32,694
He ha d compla ined of chest pa ins.

503
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:40,107
Khursheed La la. He is a n a rms pimp.

504
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:43,009
He is not connected to just one
orga niza tion but with a II of them.

505
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:46,149
If you need a rms a nd explosives
then this is your Guy.

506
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,343
He will supply a ny
qua ntity you wa nt.

507
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:52,545
No ma tter it is 1993 or 2006.
La la is behind the ba rs or free.

508
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:54,356
He doesn't lea ve a tra il.

509
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,423
Sir, you ma y remember tha t
even when you ha d a rrested him...

510
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:58,425
...we ha d only found
a blue-print of...

511
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:01,121
...the Mumba i city a nd
a revolver on him.

512
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,325
Very soon he will be out on ba il.

513
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:06,362
Sir, Here is a specula tion.

514
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:09,929
Look a t this. We don't know his
na me but he is everywhere.

515
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,166
He ha s succeeded to
rema in out of sight.

516
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,044
Our intelligence a gencies ha ve
no informa tion a bout him.

517
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:17,079
There a re only rumours.

518
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:20,448
Some sa y he is their CEO a nd others
sa y he is the chief stra tegist.

519
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:22,384
Sir, he is one a mong the crowd.

520
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,851
Even his wife doesn't know
wha t he rea lly does.

521
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:27,850
This ma n could be behind this ca II.

522
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:49,844
He ma y belong to La ska r, Al
Qa eda or some other outfit.

523
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:52,015
We don't know whether he
is in the country or not.

524
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,175
There must be a couple of people
with him in this opera tion.

525
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:57,245
They ha ve a Irea dy ta rgeted the
stock excha nge...

526
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:58,616
...buses a nd loca I tra ins.

527
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:00,815
I suspect this time they
will go a step further.

528
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:03,420
Tha t they ha ve come so close
to the police hea dqua rters...

529
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:04,788
...ha s business written a II over it.

530
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,364
Aa ka sh, this ma n is in the city.
We ha ve to ca tch him.

531
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:09,691
Sir, wha t should we do
a bout the other four?

532
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:12,166
We a re a lwa ys two steps behind
them a nd if they a re freed...

533
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:13,361
Let them be where they a re.

534
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,503
It doesn't ma ke a ny sense
to free La la now...

535
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:17,198
...he is going to get free a s is.

536
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:19,371
And by doing this La la will be
rega rded a certified terrorist.

537
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:21,377
Ma ybe they need La la right now.

538
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:22,970
Ma ybe.

539
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:26,206
Uncle! Three tea.

540
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,209
Hey, send money to me.

541
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:59,282

Ok Alright then you a nd

544
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,443

00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:34,015
...he ha d a sked me to come here.

He is wa tching our situa tion

550
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:15,124

Sir, he is a round 50. Ta II

There is a n under

554
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:56,122

00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:16,177
Should I send Ja i?

568
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,608
Three. Two. One. Go.

573
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:26,753
The police sa ys it is beca use
of security rea sons.

574
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:28,415
Right now we ha ve Senior
Inspector Ja i Singh...

00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:30,423
...who will give us full informa tion
a bout this ma tter.

576
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:34,326
Wha t is the rea son behind shifting

577
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:37,196
There a re some security rea sons.

578
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:39,296
But why such a n order?

579
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,670
We ha ve received orders to do so.

580
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,800
Ca n you tell us whether there is
a ny threa t to them a nd from whom?

581
00:45:43,941 --> 00:45:45,465
It is beca use of some

582
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:48,373
...tha t we ha ve received
orders to shift them

583
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:52,810
As you ca n see, the police is not
giving us a ny further informa tion.

584
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,441
And they a re trying to
a void our questions...

585
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:57,587
...by ca lling it a security rea son.

586
00:45:57,955 --> 00:46:00,185
From Mumba i this is Na ina Roy with

587
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:01,581
Cut it!

Tha nk you Na ina.

591
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:53,466
Once a ga in India a pproa ched America
with rega rds to Pa kista n issue.

592
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:08,992
The government is spending

00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:23,523

How much longer a re we going

608
00:50:49,273 --> 00:50:50,297
Wha t should we tell the public?

609
00:50:50,875 --> 00:50:53,002
We ha ve no other choice
tha n to ca tch him.

610
00:50:53,778 --> 00:50:56,144
He is regula rly monitoring
us through Na ina Roy.

611
00:51:02,887 --> 00:51:05,151
If we sound a n a lert
then he will know...

612
00:51:09,961 --> 00:51:11,394

I wa nt these men brought

628
00:52:03,581 --> 00:52:05,811
Only two officers should

00:52:06,417 --> 00:52:09,318
Both should ca rry cell phones
with loudspea ker fa cility.

I wa nt to know something.

635
00:52:33,444 --> 00:52:34,468

Why don't you come in the open a nd

Don't wa ste your time in trying

641
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,728
There is a fa ce behind every voice.

642
00:52:57,868 --> 00:52:58,892
I don't ha ve a fa ce.

643
00:52:59,003 --> 00:53:00,868
Tha t's wha t you think.
- No! I know it.

644
00:53:00,971 --> 00:53:04,702
Wha t is the gua ra ntee tha t you will
tell me the loca tion of the bombs?

645
00:53:04,809 --> 00:53:07,937
Gua ra ntee! Do you think I
a m selling you a product?

646
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:10,912
No. If I ha d thought so I would
not a sk you this question.

647
00:53:11,582 --> 00:53:13,311
Thousa nds of lives a re a t sta ke.

648
00:53:13,417 --> 00:53:16,045
Do you ha ve a ny other choice
tha n to trust me?

649
00:53:18,522 --> 00:53:20,387
I will ca II you a ga in a t 5.

650
00:53:24,295 --> 00:53:25,319
Aa ka sh, tell me.

00:53:25,429 --> 00:53:26,453
We ha ve a multiple tra ce.

Mulund, Sa nta cruz, Ka ra chi,
Singa pore a nd South Africa.

653
00:53:28,899 --> 00:53:30,161
This is unique. The ca II
is bounced off...

654
00:53:30,301 --> 00:53:32,166
...a nd ma nipula ted without
being disconnected...

655
00:53:32,303 --> 00:53:34,601
...from different sim ca rds a nd
la ndlines of different loca tions.

656
00:53:34,739 --> 00:53:36,366
The number switches to
a nother every minute.

657
00:53:36,507 --> 00:53:39,499
This is only possible if you route
your phone through a system.

658
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:42,511
Whoever is doing this
is a very tra ined ma n?

659
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:43,979
So you ca n't tra ce him?

660
00:53:44,115 --> 00:53:45,980
Sir, to do this we need some
other kind of a n expert.

661
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:47,774
For exa mple.
- We need a ha cker.

662
00:53:48,252 --> 00:53:50,686
Then get one. Check the booking
list of Juhu Avia tion.

663
00:53:50,888 --> 00:53:53,186
Find which priva te pla ne ha s
been booked by a nd for whom.

664
00:53:53,324 --> 00:53:55,792
Yes, sir. - Sir, there is
a sub-inspector outside.

665
00:53:55,926 --> 00:53:56,984
He ha s seen the ma n.

666
00:53:57,762 --> 00:54:02,131
Sir, I remember very well. He
ha d a bla ck ba g with him.

667
00:54:02,566 --> 00:54:04,557
He ha d come to file a report
a bout his missing wa llet.

668
00:54:04,735 --> 00:54:05,793
Wha t were you doing there?

669
00:54:07,271 --> 00:54:09,796
Sir, there wa s so much security
wha t else could I do?

670
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:11,532
This is his number a nd a ddress.

671
00:54:11,609 --> 00:54:14,009
I ha d tried his number. Am getting
a, 'does not exist messa ge.'

672
00:54:14,278 --> 00:54:16,303
I ha ve a sked the Boriva li police
to verify the a ddress.

673
00:54:16,414 --> 00:54:17,972
This is not his a ddress.
He is not such a fool.

674
00:54:18,783 --> 00:54:21,513
Ta ke him to a sketch a rtist.
Ma ke his sketch a nd show him.

675
00:54:21,619 --> 00:54:22,813
Where is Ra fiq?
- He is in Room number 12.

676
00:54:22,953 --> 00:54:25,581
Show the sketch to Ra fiq a nd
verify it. - Right sir.

677
00:54:54,552 --> 00:54:55,541

00:55:01,392 --> 00:55:04,657
Excuse me! I didn't hea r tha t.

681
00:55:04,762 --> 00:55:05,888
You a re using me.

682
00:55:06,864 --> 00:55:09,128
If you a re not interested then
you should've told me before.

683
00:55:09,266 --> 00:55:10,893
There is no dea rth
of people like you.

684
00:55:11,001 --> 00:55:13,799
I a m indirectly helping you.
I a m being pa to some...

685
00:55:13,938 --> 00:55:16,463
Come on! Come on!
Don't fla tter yourself, Na ina.

686
00:55:17,575 --> 00:55:20,135
If in a cricket ma tch between
India a nd Pa kista n...

687
00:55:20,277 --> 00:55:23,440
...lndia loses then nobody
bla mes the sports cha nnels.

688
00:55:23,547 --> 00:55:25,014
This is not a cricket ma tch!

689
00:55:25,282 --> 00:55:26,408
Yes or no!

690
00:55:28,285 --> 00:55:30,219
I ha ve a dozen phone
numbers with me.

691
00:55:30,354 --> 00:55:32,345
There a re a lot of news
hungry people out there.

692
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:33,514
Yes or no!

693
00:55:39,597 --> 00:55:40,529
Yes.

694
00:55:40,698 --> 00:55:46,193
Good. Be a t the ma in ga te of
Juhu Avia tion a t 5 o'clock.

695
00:56:16,567 --> 00:56:17,693
Pra ka sh, wha t is the pla n of a ction?

696
00:56:17,801 --> 00:56:19,132
People a re on it. But until we
don't ha ve a brea k through...

697
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:21,898
...we ha ve to do wha t he sa ys.

698
00:56:22,339 --> 00:56:26,469
This is ridicules! La w a nd order
ha s become a mere bysta nder.

699
00:56:28,512 --> 00:56:30,036
Pra ka sh, why a ren't we a ble
to do a nything a bout it?

700
00:56:30,281 --> 00:56:31,373
We ha ve such a big force, we ha ve
the intelligence burea u...

701
00:56:31,515 --> 00:56:33,039
...we ha ve RAW a nd the ATS.

702
00:56:34,785 --> 00:56:36,514
Why do we a lwa ys become
so helpless?

703
00:56:37,721 --> 00:56:40,519
We ca n't involve the media
or sound a n a lert.

704
00:56:41,325 --> 00:56:44,089
I just ca n't believe this. We
ha ve become just useless.

705
00:56:44,228 --> 00:56:45,525
Sir, we a re doing our best.

706
00:56:45,663 --> 00:56:47,688
But your best isn't good enough.

707
00:56:49,233 --> 00:56:50,632
I think we should ca II
in the a rmy a nd the...

708
00:56:50,734 --> 00:56:51,758
They won't be of a ny help.

709
00:56:51,969 --> 00:56:53,630
Sir!
- Tell me.

710
00:56:54,538 --> 00:56:57,769
I ha ve hea rd tha t ma n. I think wha t
Mr. Pra ka sh is doing is right.

711
00:56:58,242 --> 00:57:01,006
Instea d of questioning his decisions
it would be better if we help him.

712
00:57:01,245 --> 00:57:03,509
And he is competent to
dea I with this crisis.

713
00:57:05,783 --> 00:57:07,751
Which two officers a re going
to a ccompa ny them?

714
00:57:08,385 --> 00:57:09,943
Arif Kha n a nd Ja i Singh.

715
00:57:10,254 --> 00:57:13,781
Pra ka sh, you ha ve senior
experienced officers a nd you a re...

716
00:57:14,258 --> 00:57:15,748
You ha ve Sola nki...
- Plea se trust me.

717
00:57:17,261 --> 00:57:19,695
Pra ka sh, there should not be a ny
bomb bla sts in Mumba i toda y.

718
00:57:19,797 --> 00:57:20,821
There won't be a ny bomb bla sts.

719
00:57:20,965 --> 00:57:22,557
I don't wa nt to ha nd over
the four men to him.

720
00:57:22,733 --> 00:57:23,757
Tha t I will try.

721
00:57:24,868 --> 00:57:26,768
Excuse me. Yes, tell me.

722
00:57:28,172 --> 00:57:29,196
Ok.

723
00:57:37,381 --> 00:57:38,746
Sir, the Boriva li a ddress is wrong.

724
00:57:38,882 --> 00:57:39,940
There is no such building
with tha t na me.

725
00:57:40,084 --> 00:57:41,517
Where is Arif?
- He is a t the a rmory.

726
00:57:49,727 --> 00:57:51,524
Whose fa ce did you first
see when you woke up?

727
00:57:52,529 --> 00:57:53,518
My own.

728
00:57:53,697 --> 00:57:54,721
I a m not surprised.

729
00:57:55,766 --> 00:57:57,666
Are you rea dy?
- Yes sir!

730
00:58:10,547 --> 00:58:12,014
From here you will go
directly to TS Mills.

731
00:58:12,549 --> 00:58:14,813
The four men will be ha nded
over to you over there.

732
00:58:15,252 --> 00:58:18,449
The Specia I Ta sk Force is picking
them up from their current loca tions.

733
00:58:18,555 --> 00:58:19,852
Here a re the tra nsfer orders.

734
00:58:28,565 --> 00:58:32,001
Ibra him Kha n. - Let's go.

735
00:59:54,585 --> 00:59:55,574
He will ma ke a conference ca II.

736
00:59:55,753 --> 00:59:57,220
There is a loudspea ker
fa cility in this phone.

00:59:57,354 --> 00:59:59,481
You ca n listen to our conversa tion.

738
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:02,021
There a re three routes
to rea ch Juhu Avia tion.

739
01:00:02,292 --> 01:00:04,351
You will ta ke the quickest one
which is by the highwa y.

740
01:00:04,628 --> 01:00:08,894
There will a Iso be driver who will
drop a II of you there. - Yes sir!

741
01:00:09,299 --> 01:00:11,233
I don't think they will
ma ke a rescue a ttempt.

742
01:00:11,368 --> 01:00:13,336
Neither do I think they will
risk a public shootout.

743
01:00:13,437 --> 01:00:15,166
There is a da nger to their
lives in doing it.

744
01:00:15,606 --> 01:00:17,597
This is not a pre-pla nned
opera tion. It's a n extempore!

745
01:00:17,908 --> 01:00:21,241
So, tha t's it guys. Just keep
your cool. All the best.

746
01:00:21,979 --> 01:00:24,413
And come over to my pla ce in the

01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:51,469
...do something... a bout Arif.
You know wha t I mea n.

01:00:52,276 --> 01:00:53,300

755
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,353
Is he tha t qua lified?

756
01:01:12,496 --> 01:01:14,828
He is a college drop out but...
- Anuj!

757
01:01:17,935 --> 01:01:20,597

01:01:21,305 --> 01:01:23,432
No sir. All this equipment

759
01:01:23,807 --> 01:01:26,173
You a re still using NCC
3423 models while...

01:01:26,310 --> 01:01:29,336
...the S-series ha s been la unched

761
01:01:29,446 --> 01:01:30,470

My friend!

And I a Iso think...

787

I wa s a Iso like you. Too stubborn
to be a fra id of dea th.

789
01:05:18,775 --> 01:05:22,905
I wa s six yea rs old when my fa ther
got into a n enmity with a few men.

790
01:05:24,414 --> 01:05:27,042
These men kidna pped
me from the school.

791
01:05:27,584 --> 01:05:29,051
They a sked for a ra nsom
in excha nge of my life.

792
01:05:29,586 --> 01:05:33,989
My fa ther pa id the ra nsom.
But they were still greedy.

793
01:05:34,357 --> 01:05:39,021
They bea t me up. I wa s a lmost dea d.

794
01:05:40,931 --> 01:05:44,594
When they got tired they tied a
rope to my leg a nd hung me on a tree.

795
01:05:45,235 --> 01:05:47,430
I ca lled out to them. One

I screa med tha t if you ha ve to then

01:05:58,248 --> 01:06:01,274
...pa tted me on my hea d

799
01:06:02,552 --> 01:06:03,712
I lived.

800
01:06:05,388 --> 01:06:09,882
Four yea rs la ter I killed them by
ha nging them to the sa me tree.

801

You will lea ve my four

01:11:56,272 --> 01:11:58,297
...then thousa nds of

FBI, Interpol or our Intelligence.

862
01:12:55,932 --> 01:12:57,729
Neither of them ha ve a ny
informa tion a bout this ma n.

863
01:12:58,268 --> 01:13:00,532
We ha ve no choice. We ca n kill
these guys some other time.

864
01:13:03,172 --> 01:13:05,140
Pra ka sh, how ca n we justify
their disa ppea ra nce?

865
01:13:06,276 --> 01:13:07,971
There wa s a sna g in the
security so they esca ped.

866
01:13:08,578 --> 01:13:09,567
You ca n suspend me over this.

867
01:13:09,746 --> 01:13:12,681
Pra ka sh, you a re... - Excuse

868
01:13:12,782 --> 01:13:15,546
If he ca lls the next time I ca n

869
01:13:15,618 --> 01:13:16,710
Are you sure?

870
01:13:16,819 --> 01:13:19,219
Definitely. He is good.
But not the best.

871
01:13:20,189 --> 01:13:21,213
Oka y.

872
01:13:25,828 --> 01:13:27,921
Arif, remove his ha ndcuffs.

873
01:13:28,798 --> 01:13:30,163
This is not right.
If they esca pe a nd...

874
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:32,234
...they don't tell us
a bout the bombs then...

875
01:13:32,602 --> 01:13:34,365
Arif, it's Mr. Ra thod's orders.

876
01:13:34,604 --> 01:13:38,404
No Ja i. Free the other three.
Let's ta ke him with us.

877
01:13:38,541 --> 01:13:39,565
We will lea ve him

879

880
01:13:42,245 --> 01:13:43,974
I will not relea se him

881
01:13:44,247 --> 01:13:46,715
Arif, a re you cra zy? Someone
might be wa tching us.

882
01:13:46,849 --> 01:13:48,214
Then he will ca II us when

883
01:13:48,318 --> 01:13:50,513

Come on!

889
01:14:08,571 --> 01:14:10,198
Wha t will they do to lbra him bha i?

890
01:14:10,773 --> 01:14:12,570
Nothing. We will get
him freed la ter.

891
01:14:13,276 --> 01:14:14,300
Khursheed bha i, wha t
should we do next?

892
01:14:14,877 --> 01:14:17,471
We will wa it. Someone will
come to ta ke us a wa y.

893
01:14:35,598 --> 01:14:36,690
Arif!
- Wha t is it now?

894
01:14:36,799 --> 01:14:37,823
I ca n hea r a phone ringing.

I wa nt to listen to his response.

902
01:16:08,558 --> 01:16:11,186
Hold him. Hello.

903
01:16:11,327 --> 01:16:12,385
Arif, wha t is the progress?

904
01:16:12,528 --> 01:16:14,894
Sir, I a m confused.
Something else is going on here.

905
01:16:15,264 --> 01:16:17,926
Mea ns? - The pla n wa s not to
free them but to kill them.

906
01:16:18,568 --> 01:16:19,865
A bomb wa s pla nted in tha t a rea.

907
01:16:19,969 --> 01:16:22,904
As soon a s we left,
the bomb exploded.

908
01:16:23,005 --> 01:16:24,199
Both the benches were rigged.

909
01:16:26,409 --> 01:16:27,876
It mea ns, a II four of them...

910
01:16:27,977 --> 01:16:31,208
No. I ha d left only Za heer,
lqla k a nd La la over there.

911
01:16:32,949 --> 01:16:34,143
To secure the informa tion

912
01:16:34,283 --> 01:16:36,683
...I ha d kept lbra him with me.

913
01:16:38,788 --> 01:16:40,688
Yes he is with us. He is a live.

914
01:16:49,699 --> 01:16:50,723
Wha t is ha ppening?

915
01:16:50,867 --> 01:16:52,300
Arif is right, Mr. Ra thod!

916
01:16:53,369 --> 01:16:56,702
Arif, put the phone

917
01:16:56,839 --> 01:16:58,670
I wa nt lbra him to listen

And in fa ct you will complete

922
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,262
Sorry, I did not understa nd you.

923
01:17:25,501 --> 01:17:27,969
Mr. Ra thod, wha t do you do
if a cockroa ch enters you house?

924
01:17:28,571 --> 01:17:30,198
You do not ma ke it your pet,
you just kill it.

925
01:17:31,474 --> 01:17:34,966
These pests were spoiling my house
a nd now I wa nt to clea n it.

926
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,271
Who a re you?

927
01:17:39,415 --> 01:17:41,474
I a m someone who is a fra id to get
into a bus or a tra in these da ys.

928
01:17:44,554 --> 01:17:47,079
I a m someone whose wife
thinks is going to wa r...

929
01:17:47,223 --> 01:17:49,783
...while I a m a ctua lly
going to my work.

930
01:17:49,959 --> 01:17:51,290
She is a fra id tha t I ma y not return.

931
01:17:52,261 --> 01:17:54,320
She ca lls up every two hours.
To find if I ha d my tea.

932
01:17:54,463 --> 01:17:55,487
To find if I ha ve lunched.

933
01:17:56,566 --> 01:17:58,932
Actua lly she wa nts to find out
whether I a m still a live.

934
01:18:01,270 --> 01:18:04,967
I a m someone who sometimes gets
stuck in the ra in or in the bla sts.

935
01:18:06,976 --> 01:18:09,638
I a m someone who suspects the
person ca rrying a rosa ry.

936
01:18:09,745 --> 01:18:12,680
I a m a Iso the one who is a fra id
to grow his bea rd a nd wea r a ca p.

937
01:18:13,583 --> 01:18:16,108
If I buy a shop I a m a fra id
to choose a na me a s...

938
01:18:16,252 --> 01:18:19,881
...someone might see the na me
a nd burn it during the riots.

939
01:18:22,291 --> 01:18:24,122
No ma tter which two pa rties
a re fighting...

940
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:25,750
...I a m the first one to get killed.

941
01:18:28,998 --> 01:18:33,264
You must ha ve seen a crowd.
Choose a person from it.

942
01:18:33,903 --> 01:18:34,961
I a m tha t person.

943
01:18:36,072 --> 01:18:41,169
I a m just the stupid common
wa nting to clea n his house.

944
01:18:41,410 --> 01:18:43,844
How did this common
ma n suddenly wa ke up?

945
01:18:44,447 --> 01:18:46,677
And tha t too with six kgs of RDX?

946
01:18:46,949 --> 01:18:48,507
Ha s tha t got you worried now?

947
01:18:49,552 --> 01:18:51,816
Do you wa nt me to live my life
a nd die every moment of it?

948
01:18:53,956 --> 01:18:55,890
Mr. Ra thod, this did not
ha ppen a II of a sudden!

949
01:18:56,225 --> 01:18:57,692
I just did not get
the time to do it.

950
01:18:59,562 --> 01:19:02,326
In the process of ea rning my da ily
brea d this work got neglected.

951
01:19:02,531 --> 01:19:03,862
But it's better la te tha n never.

952
01:19:05,234 --> 01:19:07,225
Tha t rema ining cockroa ch
will a Iso die toda y.

953
01:19:07,336 --> 01:19:09,167
Why just these four? There
a re others a s well.

954
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:12,332
I drew a lottery a nd
I got their na mes.

955
01:19:12,875 --> 01:19:15,105
Are you trying to sa y tha t
if we don't kill lbra him...

956
01:19:15,244 --> 01:19:18,873
...then you will kill thousa nds
of innocent people?

957
01:19:19,282 --> 01:19:22,115
Sooner or la ter they a re
going to die a nd...

958
01:19:22,251 --> 01:19:24,776
...people like lbra him
will kill them.

959
01:19:25,988 --> 01:19:27,114
The la st time they were
killed in a tra in...

960
01:19:27,256 --> 01:19:29,315
...this time it will
be somewhere else.

961
01:19:30,493 --> 01:19:33,326
They will keep on killing until
we lea rn to give a solid reply.

962
01:19:33,996 --> 01:19:36,556
Who a re you?
- Wha t do you mea n?

963
01:19:36,732 --> 01:19:38,563
I mea n a re you a Hindu or a Muslim?

964
01:19:39,902 --> 01:19:42,666
This ha s nothing to
do with my religion.

965
01:19:42,772 --> 01:19:43,796
There is.

966
01:19:44,273 --> 01:19:48,471
I told you, I a m just
a stupid common ma n.

967
01:19:48,611 --> 01:19:50,670
Stupid common ma n!
- Right.

968
01:19:51,514 --> 01:19:54,381
Are you a fra id of getting
ca ught a nd getting killed?

969
01:19:56,552 --> 01:19:57,576
Ma ybe.

970
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:59,779
Be definite. You a re or you a ren't?
- I a m.

971
01:19:59,922 --> 01:20:01,150
Just remember this fea r. And
don't think you will...

972
01:20:01,290 --> 01:20:04,589
...esca pe punishment by putting this
ga rb of a stupid common ma n.

973
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:05,784
The thing you a re trying to prove...

974
01:20:05,928 --> 01:20:07,589
I a m not trying to prove a nything.

975
01:20:07,797 --> 01:20:12,598
I just wa nt to remind you
tha t people a re very a ngry.

976
01:20:12,768 --> 01:20:14,702
Plea se stop testing their pa tience.

977
01:20:15,638 --> 01:20:19,540
We a re resilient by
force not by choice.

978
01:20:20,743 --> 01:20:22,904
It took me just four weeks
to render you helpless.

979
01:20:25,314 --> 01:20:28,340
Do you suppose the people who kill
us a re more intelligent tha n us?

980
01:20:28,918 --> 01:20:31,182
Type 'bomb' in a ny internet
sea rch a nd you will get...

981
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:35,848
...hundreds of websites showing
you how to ma ke them.

982
01:20:36,058 --> 01:20:38,618
All the informa tion is a ccessible
a nd tha t too for free.

983
01:20:40,396 --> 01:20:43,559
Do you know a wa shing soa p
is a Iso a potentia I bomb?

984
01:20:45,768 --> 01:20:50,364
I feel there is no better product
ma de for the common ma n.

985
01:20:51,907 --> 01:20:55,240
The problem with us is tha t
we get used to a II this.

986
01:20:57,346 --> 01:20:59,143
If one such incidence occurs we
wa tch it on a II the cha nnels...

987
01:20:59,281 --> 01:21:01,749
...we send smses, we ca II up people.

988
01:21:02,018 --> 01:21:03,144
We get ha ppy tha t we
a re sa fe a nd then...

989
01:21:03,285 --> 01:21:07,984
...instea d of fighting a ga inst the
situa tion we sta rt to a djust with it.

990
01:21:09,925 --> 01:21:14,589
But we ha ve our compulsions.
We ha ve to ma inta in a fa mily.

991
01:21:16,832 --> 01:21:20,700
Tha t's why we a ppoint a government
to run the na tion.

992
01:21:21,971 --> 01:21:25,168
All of you. The government, the
police force, intelligence...

993
01:21:25,307 --> 01:21:28,970
...is ca pa ble of ca rrying
out this pest control.

994
01:21:29,111 --> 01:21:30,169
But you a re not doing it. Instea d
you a re just supporting their...

995
01:21:30,312 --> 01:21:31,802
...ca use by not doing
a nything stringent.

996
01:21:34,350 --> 01:21:36,614
Why a re you not nipping
them in the bud?

997
01:21:37,953 --> 01:21:41,320
It ta kes you ten yea rs to
prove a person guilty.

998
01:21:41,490 --> 01:21:44,186
Don't you think this is a question
ma rk on your a bility?

999
01:21:46,462 --> 01:21:50,228
All this should stop. This whole
bloody system is fla wed.

1000
01:21:53,402 --> 01:21:55,131
If you don't clea n up
this mess then...

1001
01:21:55,271 --> 01:21:56,704
...we will ha ve to do
something a bout it.

1002
01:21:58,007 --> 01:22:02,205
I know there will be a n imba la nce
in our civilized society.

1003
01:22:02,344 --> 01:22:03,368
But wha t ca n we do?

1004
01:22:04,613 --> 01:22:07,138
Mr. Ra thod, I a m convinced the
tra in bla sts were notjust...

1005
01:22:07,283 --> 01:22:10,275
...a terrorist a ctivity
but it wa s a question.

1006
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,147
The question wa s, we a re going
to keep killing you...

1007
01:22:13,289 --> 01:22:15,689
...wha t ca n you do? Yes!

1008
01:22:16,325 --> 01:22:17,849
They've a sked us this question.

1009
01:22:18,928 --> 01:22:22,591
First on a frida y then they
repea ted it on tuesda y.

1010
01:22:22,731 --> 01:22:24,756
I a m just replying on a Wednesda y.

1011
01:22:26,302 --> 01:22:29,328
Your, a dd-sa lt-to-ta ste philosophy,
is a bsolutely wrong.

1012
01:22:29,805 --> 01:22:30,829
This is not the correct a pproa ch.

1013
01:22:30,973 --> 01:22:32,167
I know. But right now
I a m not concerned...

1014
01:22:32,308 --> 01:22:34,799
...a bout the a pproa ch
but the results.

1015
01:22:35,344 --> 01:22:37,608
Did someone of yours
die in these bla sts?

1016
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:43,275
Why? Should I wa it until someone
close to me dies in such a di wa y?

1017
01:22:43,452 --> 01:22:45,352
And only then will you feel tha t
this step is justified?

1018
01:22:49,758 --> 01:22:51,282
If you wa nt to know then listen.

1019
01:22:52,695 --> 01:22:56,563
There wa s someone close
to me on tha t tra in.

1020
01:23:00,336 --> 01:23:01,667
A kid... must be a round 21 yea rs.

1021
01:23:04,273 --> 01:23:05,433
Don't know his na me.

1022
01:23:07,376 --> 01:23:08,900
Used to meet me everyda y in
the first cla ss compa rtment.

1023
01:23:11,914 --> 01:23:15,145
While getting into the tra in he
used to greet me with a hello...

1024
01:23:15,284 --> 01:23:17,582
...a nd I used to return the courtesy.

1025
01:23:18,020 --> 01:23:19,282
There were ma ny such people.

1026
01:23:20,589 --> 01:23:22,147
We did not know ea ch
other's na mes...

1027
01:23:22,291 --> 01:23:23,349
...Just knew ea ch other
through 'hellos'!

1028
01:23:25,094 --> 01:23:26,152
With a smile he ha d shown me...

1029
01:23:26,295 --> 01:23:28,593
...his enga gement ring
just a da y before.

1030
01:23:39,008 --> 01:23:40,032
He wa s very ha ppy.

1031
01:23:43,979 --> 01:23:46,174
The next da y I missed the
tra in a nd I esca ped dea th.

1032
01:23:47,283 --> 01:23:48,307
But he didn't.

1033
01:23:50,252 --> 01:23:51,276
After tha t when I went by tra in...

1034
01:23:51,387 --> 01:23:52,877
...there wa s nobody whom I knew.

1035
01:23:54,256 --> 01:23:55,314
The compa rtment wa s
full of stra ngers.

1036
01:24:05,301 --> 01:24:07,394
So you a re doing this
for those dea d people.

1037
01:24:07,570 --> 01:24:12,200
No. I a m not tha t emotiona I
a nd sentimenta I.

1038
01:24:13,275 --> 01:24:21,512
I a lwa ys knew wha t loss is.
I ha ve seen my rela tives die.

1039
01:24:21,884 --> 01:24:26,583
But this is una ccepta ble.

1040
01:24:29,391 --> 01:24:32,258
None of these b... pa rdon
my la ngua ge...

1041
01:24:32,962 --> 01:24:37,331
But none of these ba sta rds will
decide when I should die.

1042
01:24:39,368 --> 01:24:44,203
They a re proud of '92
a nd '93 a nd of 2006.

1043
01:24:45,774 --> 01:24:48,868
They a re proud of Guja ra t, Mumba i,
Delhi a nd Ma legoa n.

1044
01:24:48,978 --> 01:24:51,776
I a m proud of myself tha t
I a m killing such people.

1045
01:24:54,316 --> 01:24:55,908
I a m not a sa viour.

1046
01:24:56,051 --> 01:24:57,951
And I a m not doing this for
a nyone else but myself.

1047
01:24:59,955 --> 01:25:03,118
I only wa nt tha t when my child
goes out he should...

1048
01:25:03,259 --> 01:25:06,456
...tra vel without fea r on buses,
tra ins or a nywhere else.

1049
01:25:06,996 --> 01:25:08,293
I ca nnot understa nd you.

1050
01:25:08,397 --> 01:25:13,494
Tha t's beca use my rea sons a nd
dema nds a re a bit stra nge.

1051
01:25:15,371 --> 01:25:16,463
Ma ybe.

1052
01:25:16,572 --> 01:25:17,561
Be definite. Yes or no.

1053
01:25:19,808 --> 01:25:20,832
Yes.

1054
01:25:21,777 --> 01:25:24,143
If they kill 200 of
us then it is oka y...

1055
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:27,511
...but if I kill only 4 of
them then it's stra nge?

1056
01:25:30,319 --> 01:25:31,377
This is not your fa ult.

1057
01:25:31,787 --> 01:25:33,721
This is wha t is expected
of a common ma n.

1058
01:25:33,822 --> 01:25:38,418
Live, tolera te a nd die
like a common ma n.

1059
01:25:39,962 --> 01:25:42,089
Ta ke yourself for exa mple till the
time you did not know who I a m...

1060
01:25:42,231 --> 01:25:46,531
...you were a fra id of me
a nd ta king me seriously.

1061
01:25:46,669 --> 01:25:49,103
And now tha t I ha ve told
you I a m a common ma n...

1062
01:25:49,238 --> 01:25:51,263
...you've got ba ck some
confidence in your voice.

1063
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:54,102
You must be thinking this
not a terrorist but...

1064
01:25:54,243 --> 01:25:56,302
...just a common ma n. I
will ea sily ca tch him.

1065
01:25:56,445 --> 01:25:57,469
No, tha t is not so.

1066
01:25:57,579 --> 01:26:01,515
It better not be beca use a II the
bombs a re still where they were.

1067
01:26:02,284 --> 01:26:03,546
Mr. Ra thod. Arif.

1068
01:26:03,986 --> 01:26:05,112
Now everything depends on you two...

1069
01:26:05,254 --> 01:26:07,552
...whether this would be
my la st ca II or not.

1070
01:26:10,359 --> 01:26:14,227
Ten minutes la ter Na ina Roy will
rea ch there with her ca mera ma n.

1071
01:26:14,697 --> 01:26:16,756
There will a Iso be a doctor
a nd a n a mbula nce with them.

1072
01:26:17,333 --> 01:26:21,269
I wa nt confirmed reports on
TV tha t lbra him Kha n is dea d.

1073
01:26:23,005 --> 01:26:24,131
If this ha ppens then
I will immedia tely...

1074
01:26:24,273 --> 01:26:26,571
...tell you where the bombs a re.

1075
01:26:28,510 --> 01:26:32,207
But if it doesn't then you a re
responsible for wha t ha ppens next.

1076
01:26:41,523 --> 01:26:44,458
Arif, I'll ca II you ba ck.
- Yes sir.

1077
01:26:49,565 --> 01:26:51,226
Now wha t will you do?

1078
01:26:52,368 --> 01:26:54,393
First I will clea n my ea r. I
a m finding it ha rd to hea r.

1079
01:26:57,272 --> 01:26:58,830
Sir, I wa nt you to
ta ke this decision.

1080
01:27:03,345 --> 01:27:05,677
Do we ha ve a ny other choice
tha n to do wha t he sa ys?

1081
01:27:07,449 --> 01:27:08,473
No sir.

1082
01:27:09,251 --> 01:27:12,277
But it is wrong.
- Tha t it is.

1083
01:27:15,491 --> 01:27:16,549
Wha t else ca n I do? -

1084
01:27:17,693 --> 01:27:18,717
we ca n do nothing.

1085
01:27:23,399 --> 01:27:24,423
Wha t is a II this?

1086
01:27:24,566 --> 01:27:26,193
Child, wha t is 2 + 2?

1087
01:27:26,602 --> 01:27:27,626
Wha t?

1088
01:27:27,770 --> 01:27:31,137
Ten minutes from now you will
go to runwa y number 4 a nd...

1089
01:27:31,273 --> 01:27:33,298
...cover a very importa nt news.

1090
01:27:34,910 --> 01:27:36,138
Didn't I promise this would be...

1091
01:27:36,278 --> 01:27:38,576
...the most importa nt
da y of your life?

1092
01:27:40,315 --> 01:27:41,282
Go see for yourself.

1093
01:27:41,717 --> 01:27:43,912
Did you just a ddress me a s a child?

1094
01:27:44,219 --> 01:27:46,312
You ha ve hea rd right. Bye.

1095
01:27:51,460 --> 01:27:54,623
He is a tra itor! He knows nothing.

1096
01:27:55,230 --> 01:27:58,393
The ma tter is a bout our community.
Yours a nd mine.

1097
01:27:58,734 --> 01:28:00,429
It is a bout my brothers
a nd sisters a nd our home.

1098
01:28:01,236 --> 01:28:05,935
It is a bout our rights! If we a re
together nobody ca n ha rm us.

1099
01:28:06,542 --> 01:28:08,908
Didn't we tea ch the America ns
a nd British a very good lesson?

1100
01:28:09,344 --> 01:28:10,368
Nobody could stop us.

1101
01:28:10,579 --> 01:28:12,308
But you ma de a mista ke
by coming to India.

1102
01:28:13,482 --> 01:28:15,109
A common ma n got a
bit upset a nd now...

1103
01:28:15,250 --> 01:28:18,276
...not only is he stopping you
but he is killing you a s well.

1104
01:28:18,387 --> 01:28:19,411
I a m not a fra id to die...

1105
01:28:22,591 --> 01:28:25,754
I do not fea r dea th. Why a m I a live?

1106
01:28:26,528 --> 01:28:27,620
For a Ca use.

1107
01:28:28,263 --> 01:28:30,697
And for tha t ca use I a m willing
to sa crifice myself.

1108
01:28:32,301 --> 01:28:37,466
But then I wa nt to live
to wa ge this ba ttle.

1109
01:28:38,006 --> 01:28:40,907
And for my brothers a nd sisters,

1110
01:28:43,712 --> 01:28:44,804
Why a re you la ughing?

01:28:55,224 --> 01:28:58,387
I must get a deta iled report of

1114
01:28:58,861 --> 01:28:59,919
Persona lly.

1115

You will get it.

Yes sir.

1118
01:29:44,373 --> 01:29:45,465
You should've told me first.

1119
01:29:45,874 --> 01:29:47,501

...a nd some people who were
involved in this ca se unwillingly.

1170

01:35:40,362 --> 01:35:44,162
...but persona lly spea king,
wha tever it wa s. It wa s good.
