1
00:01:29,166 --> 00:01:32,290
We are identical twins...

2
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:40,082
but we are poles apart.

3
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:45,707
He lags behind
where as l, zoom ahead.

4
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:49,040
Charlie! That..

5
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:55,415
He stammers and...
l pronounce S as F.

6
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:56,707
How?

7
00:01:57,208 --> 00:02:02,249
On his death bed,
my father said "Charlie, always remember...

8
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:10,249
..life is a bitch!.
And the only way to deal with life

9
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,457
Life is to be

10
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:32,457
The path we choose doesn't screw our life...

11
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,957
There are two ways to earn a quick buck!

12
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:52,540
A shortcut...
and a shorter shortcut!

13
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,999
Get him!

14
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:14,374
l took the shortcut...,
yet my dreams got screwed.

15
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:15,707
Big time!

16
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:25,790
Blue thunder.

17
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,082
My dreams..

18
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:03,874
My sweet little dreams.

19
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:44,415
My life and my world.

20
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,040
My booking window.

21
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:55,540
ln reality...
l'm just a small time gangster.

22
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,999
Our gang fixes derbies.

23
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:09,165
Come on! Come on!

24
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:14,165
People usually wager on
the favourite to win

25
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,790
while we bet on it to lose.

26
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,999
Blue Thunder was the favourite,
in yesterday's race...

27
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:22,165
and the race was fixed.

28
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:27,540
l had bet all my savings rupees one lakh...
on that horse.

29
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,040
But the jockey double crossed us.

30
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,957
This shortcut cost me dearly.

31
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:46,124
Our booking company lost
it's reputation and fortune.

32
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,249
The company is run by
three Bengali brothers.

33
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:53,124
This is Mujeeb and that's Shumon.

34
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,290
Mikhail, the third Bengali brother.

35
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:24,624
How're you?
- The same as you!

36
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:28,207
My buddy,
dearer than my own brother.

37
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:33,332
A kid at heart but
a maniac in the head.

38
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,665
lndian National Small Arms System.

39
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,165
ln short lNSAS.

40
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,415
The heroine of the Kargil war...

41
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,040
purely homebred.

42
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,332
A distant cousin of the AK47.

43
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,790
Weight: 6.37 kgs.

44
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:53,082
Range: 700 meters.

45
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:57,165
Feed: 30 round - plastic box magazine.

46
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,874
How many can it kill in one round?

47
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,624
Sir, you'll lose count,
but the bullets will carry on.

48
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,957
Some people change with time...

49
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:12,624
and how the times change for some.

50
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,415
Arsehole...

51
00:07:17,916 --> 00:07:20,207
money can be quite the devil.

52
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:27,957
You had to pull the reins here.

53
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,624
Double cross Burgess!

54
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,165
Double cross!

55
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,790
Shumon!
- Yes...

56
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:44,499
The viewfinder is screwed.

57
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,165
Brother says the viewfinder is off mark.

58
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,457
Not possible, sir.

59
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,582
Big brother never lies!

60
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:01,707
Please don't do this.
- Do what?

61
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:08,749
You screw us all over that's cool, huh?

62
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:14,332
The sky disappeared and
my balls vanished from my boxers!

63
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,040
You know how much we lost?

64
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,957
Charlie, they will kill me.

65
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,874
And we will worship you!

66
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,707
Stop crying, you rascal!

67
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:34,415
Brother says if he
aims at Burgess' head

68
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,374
the bullet will hit the clock instead.

69
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:40,624
Not the clock... the lamp.

70
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:44,124
The lamp!

71
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,874
Please forgive me!

72
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,874
l'm the one who is screwed here.

73
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:52,332
Royally screwed!

74
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:57,249
lf l start crying,
you'll drown in my tears.

75
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,124
l want his name!

76
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:08,540
Francis!

77
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,207
Franfif?

78
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:32,165
You're growing senile day by day.

79
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:33,874
You've absolutely lost it!

80
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,082
What if l were shot?

81
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,332
My cute little darling...

82
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,999
Stop flashing your pearlies!

83
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,999
He almost crapped in his pants!

84
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,999
Even you would've crapped!

85
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,165
Such a coward!

86
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,082
You really thought he would shoot you?

87
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,040
You are shit scared!

88
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,457
What did you say?

89
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,957
Growing senile day by day?

90
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,874
You're absolutely right!

91
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,790
All three are nuts!

92
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,915
Every brother in the world is crazy.

93
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:11,957
Just like mine!

94
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:21,999
Here comes the Love Bee

95
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:37,124
Whiplash him, Fatak!

96
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:42,249
Here comes the Love Bee

97
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:47,207
Whiplash him, Fatak!

98
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:54,499
Here he comes, humming

99
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,582
Whiplash him, Fatak!

100
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,207
Here comes the Love Bee...

101
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,374
Here he comes...humming

102
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,749
Bumbling through the lanes

103
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:11,332
Hasn't found anyone worth desiring,
no, not yet

104
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:14,582
Whiplash him, Fatak!

105
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,832
He deals off his friends

106
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,790
Look at the dandy, the way he struts

107
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,999
He deals off his friends

108
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:27,374
Look at the dandy, the way he struts

109
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,332
Full of swagger and all

110
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,249
Whiplash him, Fatak!

111
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:38,082
Hurl him on the ground

112
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:41,457
Dare you count on him as a friend

113
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,790
The rogue aimlessly tramps the streets

114
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:50,540
Dare you count on him as a friend

115
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:54,332
The rogue aimlessly tramps the streets

116
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:58,582
This leech will always feed on you

117
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:02,624
He may go but will return soon

118
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,207
ln every defiled droplet of blood

119
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:10,082
To nibble your life away

120
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,082
Look, look he returns

121
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:18,082
He returns this illicit child of the night

122
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,999
Whiplash him, Fatak!

123
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,624
Here comes the Love Bee...

124
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,665
Here he comes...humming

125
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:28,915
Here comes the Love Bee...

126
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,790
Here he comes...humming

127
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,749
Here comes the Love Bee...

128
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,624
Here he comes..humming

129
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,249
Bumbling through the lanes

130
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,457
Hasn't found anyone worth desiring,
no, not yet

131
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,457
Here comes the Love Bee...

132
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:47,957
Here he comes...humming

133
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:53,874
This love is not easy

134
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:59,457
The fear of AlDS hovers around

135
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:07,040
Wear your oars

136
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:15,999
This river is made of fire

137
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:21,207
Be careful, lest your boat capsizes

138
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:25,415
Be careful, lest the Love Bee stings

139
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:26,915
Be careful, lest your boat capsizes

140
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,207
Jeetu, where's Guddu?

141
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,207
Where's Guddu?

142
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:33,999
Guddu!

143
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:35,957
We need to talk...

144
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,207
Listen!

145
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,207
Guddu listen to me...

146
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:41,999
The boat capsized...

147
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:46,790
Capsized!

148
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,790
Let's do another test?

149
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,957
This was the third.

150
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,582
When did you go for the other two?

151
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,124
Why didn't you tell me?

152
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,582
l didn't want to stress you out
- And now?

153
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,124
Now where's your s... s...

154
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,124
Sincerity?

155
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:48,707
Safety?

156
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,915
What is it?
- Science!

157
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,915
Home science? Huh?

158
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,290
lt was right here...

159
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,249
Kama Sutra condoms, a full packet.

160
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,082
Forget about it.

161
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:11,499
l'm a topper in home science.

162
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:14,707
Home science?

163
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:16,582
What do you mean?

164
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,249
l mean...

165
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,665
there's no danger today.

166
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,040
l don't like anything between us.

167
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:40,040
Nothing!

168
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:45,665
Glad the damn thing is lost.

169
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,249
Let me take one last look...

170
00:15:56,458 --> 00:16:00,249
it's got to be here.
- You're such a dork.

171
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:01,624
Let it be!

172
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,832
Do you know the distance
it creates between us?

173
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,207
Like l'm in New York and...

174
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:19,040
you're in New... New...

175
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,207
New Jersey?

176
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,915
New
- New Zealand?

177
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:25,415
New Delhi?

178
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:28,499
New... New...

179
00:16:28,708 --> 00:16:32,165
New Bombay.

180
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:37,374
Not Bombay... Mumbai.

181
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,790
You love Mumbai?

182
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:26,124
Yes, doctor.
l'll call you later.

183
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:34,332
He says it will be done in a day.

184
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,707
l can be back in four hours...

185
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:43,290
same day.

186
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,082
Fix an appointment for tomorrow?

187
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:58,665
Please say something.
- Do as you like.

188
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:01,082
l won't be part of this murder.

189
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:02,915
What do you mean?

190
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,249
Oh my!

191
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:12,874
Got it!

192
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,249
My single piece.

193
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:23,457
We'll sail through!

194
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,624
l'm ready to be a mother...

195
00:18:26,833 --> 00:18:29,040
But l'm not ready to become a father!

196
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,665
Please understand, my dear!

197
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:37,665
We don't have enough
to support each other.

198
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:42,999
How do we support a child?

199
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,999
Things will fall into place.

200
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,415
This is our destiny.

201
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,832
Our destiny is screwed.
Big time!

202
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,999
l can't get married right now.
Period!

203
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,207
Why not?

204
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:08,415
All yours.

205
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:14,999
My life... my plan... my future...

206
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:25,582
Marriage in 2014...

207
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:27,999
and honeymoon in 2009!

208
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,582
Bravo Mr Sharma.
Bravo!

209
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,165
You wanted it!

210
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,249
And you didn't?

211
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:39,915
No!

212
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,332
So l must have raped you then!?

213
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,332
And all those promises...

214
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,540
was it the booze?

215
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:14,957
Baby! lt feels as though
l've known you for ages.

216
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,749
Please, listen...

217
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,290
l'll take up a job.

218
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:32,082
But l still can't marry you now.
l mean...

219
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,207
l mean... l mean...
What do you mean?

220
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:39,999
You don't want an abortion
nor want to marry.

221
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,499
What do you want?

222
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,665
l just want to die.

223
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:51,499
Fine! Go die!

224
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,624
Please Guddu... please...

225
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,457
l can't see you die.

226
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,999
l am not committing suicide.

227
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,082
l know but if
we don't get married soon...

228
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,040
you'll be killed for sure.

229
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,582
Listen... my full name is...

230
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,499
Sweety Shekhar Bhope.

231
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:24,040
l'm Sunil "Chopper" Bhope's sister.

232
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:30,999
Guddu...

233
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:43,124

235
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,165
Hail Maharashtra!

236
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:04,999
We sent someone to check.

237
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,415
She hasn't been to college
for a month.

238
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:08,999
Uncle

239
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:10,582
Been bunking!

240
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,790
Who's the boy?
- l want a chocolate!

241
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:17,999
Some "Guddu".

242
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:22,499
Address?
- Navi Mumbai

243
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,790
Uncle, l want a chocolate...
- Shut up!

244
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,582
Miser!

245
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,790
Get the cars out!
- Chief, listen to me...

246
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:37,124
We've got that interview
lined up for today.

247
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,332
lt's taken us 1 5 years
to clear our name.

248
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:47,999
Today is your interview.
Live on television.

249
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:52,040
Just relax and...

250
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,124
let me handle this.

251
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,124
Trust me on this one.

252
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:02,457
Look at that

253
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:06,540
your blood sugar level
is down to 1 1 0.

254
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:10,915
We'll slice the boy
and serve him for dessert.

255
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:17,915
Hail Maharashtra!

256
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,915
lt's not my fault that
he is my brother!

257
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:50,332
The fault is that you lied to me.

258
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:55,040
Why?

259
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:06,082
Don't you trust me?

260
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:15,249
Have some water.

261
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:17,999
Add some poison as well.

262
00:24:22,625 --> 00:24:23,957
Then you will die.

263
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:27,415
At least l'll be out of your way.

264
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:31,624
That's the point!

265
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,207
l'm as good as dead without you!

266
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:45,207
Then we will float around as ghosts!

267
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:51,082
And your brother can't stop
ghosts from getting married.

268
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,999
There's a slight problem though.

269
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:01,124
Can ghosts have kids?

270
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:15,999
So... when do we take the plunge?

271
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:20,999
Today

272
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:24,540
now...

273
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,957
Hello... hello...

274
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,082
Can you hear me?

275
00:25:37,541 --> 00:25:39,124
Yes, go ahead.

276
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,665
Yes, it's fixed.

277
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:48,124
Eight o'clock? Hold on...

278
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:49,749
ls eight o'clock fine?

279
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,957
For what?
- Our wedding...

280
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:56,332
Eii... eight...
- Yeah... eight o'clock.

281
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:57,499
Today?

282
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,290
No... in 2014!

283
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:07,040
Yes... eight o'clock sounds good.

284
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:13,290
When days are dogs
Life's a bitch!

285
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:17,040
Once there was
some integrity in this business...

286
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:18,915
but not anymore!

287
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:24,499
And now, my mind is occupied
with just one name...

288
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,499
Franfif!

289
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,457
l found Franfif...

290
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:35,999
Awesome!

291
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,790
He is staying right here.

292
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:41,457
Room 71 6.

293
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:46,874
He fixing a race right now!

294
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:49,665
Alright, l'll inform big bro.
Leave right now.

295
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,040
And when l say leave,
you better leave.

296
00:26:57,541 --> 00:26:58,249
Let's go.

297
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:04,415
Come on...

298
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,957
We leave this way.

299
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:17,415
But destiny lies that way.

300
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:49,915
Mr Narang?

301
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:57,999
From today l'm Tashi's pet...

302
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:19,665
Where are you?
- Where do you think?

303
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,665
Got the guitar?

304
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:35,874
Come over to the Madh lsland bungalow.

305
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:39,040
Cool!

306
00:29:40,041 --> 00:29:43,249
Afghanibhai, is Tashi around?

307
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:44,874
Why?

308
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,665
The airline guys are offering a deal.

309
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:50,207
Hold on...

310
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:52,624
Tashi...

311
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:56,999
the flight purser at the hotel
has something to say.

312
00:30:00,625 --> 00:30:01,624
Go on...

313
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:31,790
Tashi, he wants to say that
he is now your pet dog.

314
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:40,999
l have far too many dogs.

315
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:44,999
What the hell!

316
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,374
Where are the Africans?
- ln Goa.

317
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:55,082
Call them.

318
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,749
Tell them the guitar
has been arranged for.

319
00:31:12,708 --> 00:31:16,749
They will pick you up
for the race course tomorrow.

320
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:22,124
The Bengal is are
sniffing you down like rabid dogs.

321
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:30,290
Anything you need,
will be delivered to your room.

322
00:31:34,791 --> 00:31:38,499
But l'll need a wakeup call.

323
00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:42,082
l'll be fast sleep,
counting horses instead of sheep.

324
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:11,874
How the times have changed...

325
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:44,957
You got your gun on you?
- Yes.

326
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:52,499
Go back and give it to him.
- Okay.

327
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:56,415
Why take a chance?

328
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,624
Meet me in the parking lot.
- Okay.

329
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:06,999
l want my money back.
One lakh.

330
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,374
He only has pennies.

331
00:33:13,666 --> 00:33:14,999
Look for his ATM card.

332
00:33:17,666 --> 00:33:18,999
You want to
become a bookie, don't you?

333
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,374
l'll get it done in a jiffy.

334
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:30,374
Let's just give the gun and leave.

335
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:49,124
Packing the whole hotel in or what?

336
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:02,749
Help! Room Service!

337
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:10,249
This way! Come along!

338
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:23,832
Shut it!

339
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,624
What was that?

340
00:35:55,083 --> 00:36:00,374
Stop the car!
Damn it! Stop the car!

341
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:12,165
They're getting away!
- Stop them!

342
00:36:22,583 --> 00:36:26,165
Damn! Cops! We are screwed!
- Don't freak out!

343
00:36:26,666 --> 00:36:29,124
Steve... pass my shades!
My shades!

344
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,332
We'll make it, don't worry.

345
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,540
That was close.

346
00:36:43,916 --> 00:36:46,332
You knew that guy?
- Nope!

347
00:36:46,958 --> 00:36:49,624
Then why did you salute him?

348
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,040
Because he saluted me!

349
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,957
Why would a cop salute you?

350
00:37:15,916 --> 00:37:16,499
What!?

351
00:37:18,916 --> 00:37:20,915
Hey junkies...
What the hell?

352
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:31,707
Sir, seems like it was a major deal.

353
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,665
And it went wrong!

354
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,540
On the floor where
we found the dead bodies...

355
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:41,249
the security cameras were damaged

356
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,249
What are you doing?

357
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:51,457
Did you have prior information?

358
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:55,790
We were expecting someone but...

359
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,082
did you check
the other security cameras?

360
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:01,874
No, it's being done.
- Then do it!

361
00:38:19,708 --> 00:38:20,749
You want to talk?

362
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:24,624
Okay... move it!

363
00:38:27,416 --> 00:38:29,999
Where the hell are you?
- Afghanibhai...

364
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,957
There's a problem.
We were leaving the hotel

365
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:38,457
but got stuck
in a crossfire between two gangs.

366
00:38:38,666 --> 00:38:43,999
You are still in Panvel?
- Yes and the DCP is here as well.

367
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:47,499
lt's difficult to leave.
- Like l care!

368
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:52,999
We fixed the delivery
as per your time.

369
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:57,207
l get it but...
please try and understand.

370
00:38:57,416 --> 00:39:01,999
Try telling this to Tashi.
l'll hand him the phone.

371
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:06,582
Look, security is tight
and sniffer dogs are around.

372
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:09,790
What's more important?
Guitar's safety or scheduled delivery?

373
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,999
Fine! Commit a final time!

374
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:17,124
Problem, safety and all that.
Tell me!

375
00:39:18,208 --> 00:39:19,749
Eight...
- Eight o'clock.

376
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,332
Tomorrow morning?

377
00:39:22,458 --> 00:39:27,749
Why don't you come over here
and collect it yourself.

378
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:41,790
OK!
But eight means eight, clear?

379
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,749
Loud and clear!

380
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:45,124
By the way...

381
00:39:46,666 --> 00:39:49,249
the guitar is safe?
- Should l play a tune?

382
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:51,249
See you tomorrow.
- Tune?

383
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:19,457
Where is Sweety?
- Tear this place apart!

384
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:26,040
Tell me or l'll break your head!

385
00:41:29,458 --> 00:41:31,540
He is Charlie's brother.

386
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,040
Charlie who?

387
00:41:35,333 --> 00:41:37,540
That gambler from the train yard!

388
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:48,374
Chief, there is good news
and bad news.

389
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:52,999
He seems to be a nice guy.

390
00:41:53,166 --> 00:41:56,290
Works for an NGO besides...
Bad! Give me the bad!

391
00:41:57,458 --> 00:41:59,540
They genuinely love each other!

392
00:42:01,208 --> 00:42:02,249
They're getting married.

393
00:42:03,875 --> 00:42:05,249
l could stop it if you say so.

394
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:10,249
But they do look like...
they're made for each other.

395
00:42:10,416 --> 00:42:12,499
l'll get your mom hooked up with him!

396
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:15,915
Get me Sweety on the phone!
- Yes, Chief!

397
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:18,624
As soon as l get there.

398
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:18,832
Damn it! What's going on!

399
00:46:20,041 --> 00:46:21,582
From the frying pan into the fire...

400
00:46:22,583 --> 00:46:25,582
and back into the frying pan!

401
00:46:26,625 --> 00:46:30,332
Forget it.

402
00:46:30,708 --> 00:46:32,124
Don't even think about it!

403
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,540
Just get away!

404
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:52,957
Charlie...

405
00:46:53,291 --> 00:46:54,540
The shortcut

406
00:46:55,875 --> 00:46:57,540
or the shorter fhortcut!

407
00:46:58,375 --> 00:47:00,207
But - But what?

408
00:47:01,875 --> 00:47:03,082
Don't forget!

409
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:08,040
The path you choose doesn't screw your life...

410
00:47:08,166 --> 00:47:10,082
what screws you is...

411
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:13,915
the one you leave behind!

412
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:42,290
Greetings, everyone.

413
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,457
Please remain seated.

414
00:47:46,083 --> 00:47:47,249
Sweety dear...

415
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,874
Where have you been?

416
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:54,874
Been looking all over for you.

417
00:48:01,958 --> 00:48:05,874
Greetings!
l am your brother-in-law.

418
00:48:14,208 --> 00:48:18,040
l consider myself an lndian first
and then a Marathi.

419
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:21,665
But what annoys me is that
my house guest...

420
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:23,207
who shares my food...

421
00:48:23,416 --> 00:48:25,040
shares my wages...

422
00:48:25,208 --> 00:48:26,290
drinks my milk...

423
00:48:26,666 --> 00:48:28,415
saves the butter
for his own toast.

424
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:31,415
How is that fair?

425
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:33,415
Now even...
- Cut!

426
00:48:41,166 --> 00:48:42,165
Brother...

427
00:48:44,083 --> 00:48:45,790
Why are you doing this to me?

428
00:48:49,041 --> 00:48:52,624
l wanted to make
your wedding a grand affair.

429
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:56,790
Why did you hurt me?

430
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:03,165
You wanted me to
marry that builder's son...- So?

431
00:49:03,333 --> 00:49:08,165
And who is this boy?
What is his name?

432
00:49:08,666 --> 00:49:09,957
Tell me...

433
00:49:11,041 --> 00:49:12,165
Sanjay...

434
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:17,290
Sanjay?
Give me his full name!

435
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,249
Sanjay Kumar Sharma,
son of Kishan Kumar Sharma...

436
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,124
bows to the 25 crores
Gods and Goddesses...

437
00:49:22,166 --> 00:49:23,457
Hang on!

438
00:49:23,666 --> 00:49:25,957
Come again. What is his name?

439
00:49:28,208 --> 00:49:29,249
Sanjay Kumar Sharma.

440
00:49:29,458 --> 00:49:30,665
Sanjay Kumar Sharma?

441
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:33,124
Where are you from?

442
00:49:34,666 --> 00:49:35,540
Barabanki.

443
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:38,874
Barabanki? U.P.?

444
00:49:39,125 --> 00:49:41,207
Holy crap!

445
00:49:41,416 --> 00:49:45,540
Give me the phone.
Just give the damn phone!

446
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:48,540
Chief... we are screwed!

447
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:52,707
He is a bloody migrant, from U.P.!

448
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:56,624
We've identified the dead bodies.

449
00:49:57,125 --> 00:49:58,582
They belong to the K D Narang gang.

450
00:49:59,208 --> 00:50:01,707
But the boy in the camera footage

451
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:03,874
Don't know how he is connected to this.

452
00:50:05,041 --> 00:50:06,582
lnvestigations are still on.

453
00:50:08,458 --> 00:50:09,499
This way, Sir...

454
00:50:09,708 --> 00:50:10,499
Play it.

455
00:50:12,666 --> 00:50:15,082
Rewind... slower...

456
00:50:16,416 --> 00:50:18,874
Get him! Closer.

457
00:51:13,291 --> 00:51:15,040
Beat the crap out of him.

458
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:17,374
Bloody migrant!

459
00:51:17,583 --> 00:51:19,207
Let him go...

460
00:51:22,291 --> 00:51:25,915
l would've killed you right now...

461
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:31,582
You sons of bitches!

462
00:51:31,791 --> 00:51:35,165
Leave him...
- Sweety get away!

463
00:51:36,625 --> 00:51:39,957
Guddu, get up!
Dare not touch him!

464
00:51:40,125 --> 00:51:41,165
Don't you get it?

465
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:49,457
Your chief is ready to
trade his sister for votes.

466
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:55,082
l don't want to marry
that builder's wretched son.

467
00:51:56,416 --> 00:51:59,124
At least you should've supported me.

468
00:52:00,125 --> 00:52:02,540
l'll speak to chief...
- Back off!

469
00:52:03,958 --> 00:52:04,957
You...

470
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:09,332
Get the car keys.
Move it!

471
00:52:10,625 --> 00:52:14,832
To hell with the polictics...
that builder's son

472
00:52:15,041 --> 00:52:15,874
To hell with brother!

473
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:18,499
l'll talk to him...

474
00:52:18,541 --> 00:52:20,957
Douse the fire!

475
00:52:21,125 --> 00:52:25,540
They're getting away!

476
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:30,165
Take it easy. Don't be a fool.

477
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:31,790
He is part of the family.

478
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,374
l'm here to do business!

479
00:53:34,583 --> 00:53:37,665
Watch what you say! - He's right.

480
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:00,207
Awesome! Killer stuff!

481
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:01,915
Where did you get it from?

482
00:54:05,166 --> 00:54:05,665
How much do l get?

483
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,624
How much do you want?

484
00:54:09,208 --> 00:54:10,207
Ten!

485
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:12,415
You got it!

486
00:54:14,083 --> 00:54:14,999
Lakhs!

487
00:54:18,666 --> 00:54:19,790
For one packet?

488
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:23,374
A hundred packets!

489
00:54:29,416 --> 00:54:30,165
Come again?

490
00:54:32,333 --> 00:54:33,165
A hundred!

491
00:54:37,208 --> 00:54:41,207
You created a ruckus
at the hotel, didn't you?

492
00:54:42,875 --> 00:54:44,999
l told you to leave immediately.

493
00:54:46,666 --> 00:54:49,124
Leaving wouldn't have helped.

494
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:53,082
Opportunity came knocking
and l grabbed it!

495
00:54:53,125 --> 00:54:54,332
Lady luck smiled on me!

496
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:14,499
A hundred packets of...
cocaine!

497
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:16,332
And they belong to?

498
00:55:18,916 --> 00:55:19,540
Us!

499
00:55:20,833 --> 00:55:24,665
What will you do with ten lakhs?

500
00:55:32,375 --> 00:55:33,665
l'll become a bookie.

501
00:55:36,125 --> 00:55:39,457
You bloody scoundrel!

502
00:55:40,791 --> 00:55:44,707
Open your mouth
- ha ha ha!- No...

503
00:55:46,458 --> 00:55:48,749
With a hundred packets
we'll make enough...

504
00:55:48,958 --> 00:55:51,499
to own the entire racecourse!

505
00:55:52,041 --> 00:55:52,957
And then!

506
00:55:55,666 --> 00:56:00,624
Spain... France... Miami... Copacabana...

507
00:56:00,833 --> 00:56:02,874
Psychedelic Trance! Dude!

508
00:56:03,916 --> 00:56:04,790
Come on!

509
00:56:05,958 --> 00:56:08,082
Let's rock!

510
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:11,249
Shake the booty!

511
00:56:19,583 --> 00:56:22,165
Come, let's wring our hearts

512
00:56:22,375 --> 00:56:24,874
Smash the pot of the night

513
00:56:25,083 --> 00:56:27,249
Come, let's pry out some good luck

514
00:56:27,458 --> 00:56:30,249
Let's break into the vault

515
00:56:41,208 --> 00:56:43,832
Tiny sprouts of leafy cress,
and oil from oilman's press

516
00:56:44,041 --> 00:56:47,374
Life is nothing but money's play

517
00:56:54,583 --> 00:56:57,207
Let's have a face-off on the roads tonight

518
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,540
Step out
Life is a one way

519
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:40,040
All you get is one chance

520
00:57:40,208 --> 00:57:41,832
Nothing ahead but thin air

521
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:45,249
And the romance lasts till the breath does

522
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:03,207
This is what they say

523
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:05,707
This is what we hear

524
00:58:05,875 --> 00:58:07,374
Whosoever surges ahead

525
00:58:07,583 --> 00:58:10,082
Never does come back

526
00:58:10,125 --> 00:58:13,082
Come, let's wring tomorrow

527
00:58:13,333 --> 00:58:15,790
Smash the pot of the night

528
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,499
Come, let's pry out some good luck

529
00:58:18,708 --> 00:58:21,499
Tonight, let's break into the vault

530
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:24,124
Tiny sprouts of leafy cress,
and oil from oilman's press

531
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:26,790
Life is nothing but money's play

532
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,082
Let's have a face-off on the roads tonight

533
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:45,165
Looks like an amateur crook.

534
00:58:45,583 --> 00:58:49,165
The revolver, money,
everything is still here.

535
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:53,040
ls anything missing?

536
00:58:53,083 --> 00:58:55,915
This time lets play such a game

537
00:58:56,083 --> 00:58:59,165
That the ocean walks over the bridge

538
00:58:59,791 --> 00:59:01,707
Then whether you walk on the bridge or l

539
00:59:01,916 --> 00:59:04,540
The city will stay under our feet

540
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:07,124
Somewhere the news are grave

541
00:59:07,166 --> 00:59:09,499
Somewhere there are just graves

542
00:59:09,708 --> 00:59:14,290
Hush! Let's not wake up the dead

543
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:17,040
Come, let's wring our hearts

544
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:19,540
Smash the pot of the night

545
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:22,249
Come, let's pry out some good luck

546
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:24,624
Let's break into the vault

547
00:59:52,083 --> 00:59:55,249
Dhan te nan...!

548
01:00:10,166 --> 01:00:11,874
l've got the tickets and passports.

549
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:15,165
Go and freshen up soon!

550
01:00:19,541 --> 01:00:23,124
l'll get the first-aid box.
Hurry up!

551
01:00:27,041 --> 01:00:30,124
We will miss the flight!
What is wrong with you?

552
01:00:54,041 --> 01:00:55,207
What's wrong?

553
01:00:59,875 --> 01:01:04,415
l almost flunked in the sixth grade.

554
01:01:07,083 --> 01:01:08,082
What?

555
01:01:19,916 --> 01:01:24,124
We sat on the same bench.
Both of us.

556
01:01:26,625 --> 01:01:27,665
Who both?

557
01:01:30,916 --> 01:01:32,165
Sabiha and l.

558
01:01:35,041 --> 01:01:37,249
Sabiha Laeek Ahmed.

559
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:42,082
l was in love with her.

560
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:50,540
She loved hearings...
stories from me.

561
01:01:53,166 --> 01:01:55,040
Champak, Nandan...

562
01:01:56,583 --> 01:01:58,374
Bela Bahadur... comics.

563
01:02:02,291 --> 01:02:04,832
Then one day l realised...

564
01:02:07,083 --> 01:02:08,124
it wasn't the stories she loved.

565
01:02:12,625 --> 01:02:18,624
lt was my fumbling that made her laugh.

566
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:23,415
Once l caught her...

567
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:26,915
imitating me.

568
01:02:28,416 --> 01:02:30,207
Gh... gh... gh.

569
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,165
That's when l realised that...

570
01:02:37,958 --> 01:02:39,165
not only do l stammer...

571
01:02:43,041 --> 01:02:45,999
but l'm a duffer too.

572
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:49,165
Listen...

573
01:02:49,875 --> 01:02:53,374
you can narrate
the rest at the a... a... aiirp

574
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:54,874
Just remembered, didn't you?

575
01:02:56,583 --> 01:02:57,582
The stammer?

576
01:03:01,833 --> 01:03:04,374
What happened back there
at the war zone?

577
01:03:05,791 --> 01:03:06,540
Forgot your cues?

578
01:03:12,916 --> 01:03:17,332
Why pull this farce on me?

579
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:25,124
How many more lies?

580
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:40,707
Every lie had an honest intention...
- Another lie!

581
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:59,290
We'll miss our flight...
- What's the hurry?

582
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:08,499
Let's get to know each other better.

583
01:04:12,125 --> 01:04:13,665
l'm your wife.

584
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:15,124
That's a lie!

585
01:04:17,125 --> 01:04:19,665
You are Bhope's sister!

586
01:04:24,291 --> 01:04:27,249
l'm carrying your child.
- Really?

587
01:04:27,541 --> 01:04:28,790
Are you sure it's mine?

588
01:04:36,166 --> 01:04:37,582
l'll kill you!

589
01:05:37,125 --> 01:05:38,249
Cheater!

590
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,082
You'll die soon!

591
01:05:48,791 --> 01:05:53,540
As if you'll live forever!

592
01:05:53,708 --> 01:05:55,124
How about l slit your throat?

593
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:02,749
Do you know the stuff's worth?

594
01:06:05,208 --> 01:06:07,332
Ten crores!

595
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:11,249
Crores?

596
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:15,874
The stuff is worth ten crores!?

597
01:06:17,125 --> 01:06:21,124
Yeah man! Ten crores!

598
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:24,124
At least.

599
01:06:26,125 --> 01:06:27,832
Go on darling...

600
01:06:29,208 --> 01:06:30,290
get the stuff, quick!

601
01:06:32,625 --> 01:06:34,290
l'll set up some deals till then.

602
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:39,082
Now get going!

603
01:06:39,916 --> 01:06:41,290
Ten! Arsehole!

604
01:06:53,333 --> 01:06:55,290
l'll be back in five.
- Make it quick!

605
01:07:03,916 --> 01:07:05,457
Hello... big bro...

606
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:18,665
Staying alive...

607
01:07:24,125 --> 01:07:28,540
Stop behaving like the bride
and lend me a hand!

608
01:07:29,666 --> 01:07:31,832
Please come in Mr Sharma.

609
01:07:32,041 --> 01:07:35,415
Sorry... we barged in unannounced!

610
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:39,790
We waited outside for a while...

611
01:07:40,041 --> 01:07:41,040
but we were hungry...

612
01:07:46,833 --> 01:07:50,040
Nothing beats fresh burgers
on a rainy day!

613
01:07:53,833 --> 01:07:55,749
Please have a seat.

614
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:08,582
To tell you the truth...

615
01:08:09,541 --> 01:08:11,582
we are looking for the groom.

616
01:08:13,166 --> 01:08:15,165
Excuse me?

617
01:08:16,166 --> 01:08:17,165
Guddu.

618
01:08:32,125 --> 01:08:34,790
How many brothers are you?

619
01:08:38,041 --> 01:08:38,582
Two.

620
01:08:40,125 --> 01:08:41,540
lf you were three

621
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:43,957
would you parade me naked?

622
01:08:47,166 --> 01:08:48,124
What do you do?

623
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,874
Builder, chief...
Body builder!

624
01:08:52,166 --> 01:08:56,707
Wow Mr. Sharma...

625
01:08:57,041 --> 01:08:59,124
Well built, l'm impressed!

626
01:09:01,541 --> 01:09:02,749
Do you have a sister?

627
01:09:06,166 --> 01:09:07,124
l have one.

628
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:10,540
Your brother screwed her.

629
01:09:11,666 --> 01:09:14,082
And now they're getting married.

630
01:09:15,375 --> 01:09:16,915
Weren't you invited?

631
01:09:19,625 --> 01:09:20,290
Doesn't matter now...

632
01:09:21,375 --> 01:09:22,790
neither was l.

633
01:09:25,125 --> 01:09:26,499
Where can we find him?

634
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:31,082
lt's been three years since...

635
01:09:32,083 --> 01:09:33,499
l saw his shitty face.

636
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:34,707
l swear!

637
01:09:37,916 --> 01:09:39,082
Right now...

638
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:42,665
l need to take care of
something important.

639
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:47,249
l'll call you once l hear from him.

640
01:09:47,458 --> 01:09:49,040
Can l have your fell number?

641
01:09:53,875 --> 01:09:55,249
What's he saying?

642
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:57,665
Which number?

643
01:09:58,250 --> 01:09:59,040
Fell.

644
01:10:00,416 --> 01:10:01,165
Mobile.

645
01:10:04,875 --> 01:10:07,040
Do you lisp?

646
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:14,457
Not really...
l pronounce S as F...

647
01:10:14,666 --> 01:10:18,207
lf not as F,
will you pronounce it as L?

648
01:10:21,833 --> 01:10:23,415
What about your brother?

649
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:25,832
Does he lisp as well?

650
01:10:29,416 --> 01:10:30,749
He stammers.

651
01:10:34,875 --> 01:10:36,207
One lisps and...

652
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:38,415
the other stammers!

653
01:10:59,375 --> 01:11:00,790
Where is he?

654
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:05,165
He is inside.
But there is some confusion.

655
01:11:05,375 --> 01:11:06,165
This way.

656
01:11:12,041 --> 01:11:14,374
l'm tired of repeating myself.

657
01:11:15,250 --> 01:11:18,040
You can't keep me here,
without a warrant.

658
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:20,624
This is against the law.
- Against the law?

659
01:11:20,666 --> 01:11:22,999
We'll take it from here. Thank you.
- Sir?

660
01:11:25,083 --> 01:11:26,124
Didn't you hear him?

661
01:11:27,125 --> 01:11:30,124
Get moving. Now!

662
01:11:34,625 --> 01:11:37,124
The law does not p... p...
permit this?

663
01:11:39,125 --> 01:11:40,749
So you're the lawmaker now?

664
01:11:41,416 --> 01:11:47,332
There has been a misunders... s... s...

665
01:11:47,666 --> 01:11:49,124
Here... have a seat.

666
01:11:49,833 --> 01:11:50,540
Sit down!

667
01:11:54,125 --> 01:11:58,707
l... l...

668
01:11:58,916 --> 01:12:04,332
l'm not who you th... th...
think l am.

669
01:12:04,541 --> 01:12:08,915
And who is that?
- l'm not Ch... Ch... Ch...

670
01:12:09,041 --> 01:12:10,082
Chimpanzee!

671
01:12:11,541 --> 01:12:12,707
That's what we are!

672
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:15,415
Where's the guitar?

673
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:21,415
What gui... gui...

674
01:12:25,041 --> 01:12:27,290
This is going to take all night!

675
01:12:30,666 --> 01:12:32,249
Why don't you sing something?

676
01:12:32,583 --> 01:12:33,582
Sing?

677
01:12:36,458 --> 01:12:38,082
What?
- A song!

678
01:12:43,083 --> 01:12:44,665
Can't get it started.

679
01:12:45,833 --> 01:12:48,874
Water might have seeped in.
- Take your time!

680
01:12:50,041 --> 01:12:52,457
Have you ever met him?

681
01:12:53,083 --> 01:12:55,665
No.
- Good for you. You've been lucky!

682
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:58,915
He brings misfortune!

683
01:12:59,083 --> 01:13:01,665
There could be no worse omen...

684
01:13:01,875 --> 01:13:03,790
than to see his shitty face.

685
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,332
You mentioned him
and my phone conked out!

686
01:13:12,083 --> 01:13:13,040
What's going on here?

687
01:13:13,958 --> 01:13:18,124
l'm out in the rain cracking deals
and you're chilling in here!

688
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:22,207
Mikhail, l'll be out with you in a bit!

689
01:13:22,625 --> 01:13:24,249
Hold on...

690
01:13:27,541 --> 01:13:29,207
Something smells fishy!

691
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:34,207
Hey you...

692
01:13:37,375 --> 01:13:40,165
Are you giving
my brother a hard time?

693
01:13:42,541 --> 01:13:45,165
Chief, hold on to your pants!

694
01:13:45,541 --> 01:13:47,999
The third brother is here!

695
01:13:51,333 --> 01:13:54,415
You don't get it, Mikhail.
He is Chief Bhope.

696
01:13:54,625 --> 01:13:57,082
Chief... who?
- Chief Bhope! You should leave.- So?

697
01:14:01,041 --> 01:14:02,332
l'm Chief Tope!

698
01:14:03,916 --> 01:14:06,457
Chief Tope, Chief Bhope,
Chief Chief Bhope Tope...

699
01:14:06,666 --> 01:14:07,999
Chief Bhope Chief Tope...

700
01:14:08,166 --> 01:14:09,874
Bhope Tope
Chief Tope Bhope Chief...

701
01:14:10,041 --> 01:14:11,540
Bhope Tope Boom!

702
01:14:13,416 --> 01:14:15,124
The stuff has been sold.

703
01:14:16,041 --> 01:14:17,290
So kindly leave.

704
01:14:18,166 --> 01:14:20,332
Or l'll pluck out
your chilli and two nuts

705
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:24,249
and pawn them at the traffic signal.
Got it!?

706
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:28,124
You still don't get it!
- No, no... hold it!

707
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,957
He gets everything!

708
01:14:32,125 --> 01:14:35,540
Chief Tope, this way...
- Watch it!

709
01:14:35,916 --> 01:14:38,332
You're a great man.

710
01:14:39,166 --> 01:14:42,374
l bow down to...
the dude of this century!

711
01:14:42,583 --> 01:14:44,707
Why don't you have a seat, please...

712
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,624
A burger... quick!

713
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:58,290
We are two brothers...

714
01:15:02,041 --> 01:15:04,374
ldentical twins...

715
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:08,499
thus we look the same.

716
01:15:09,041 --> 01:15:09,915
Brother...

717
01:15:12,333 --> 01:15:13,915
you are great!

718
01:15:14,708 --> 01:15:16,624
Doesn't stammer while singing.

719
01:15:18,083 --> 01:15:22,665
Go on...

720
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:25,249
Listen, he...

721
01:15:25,416 --> 01:15:27,040
Keep singing.

722
01:15:33,166 --> 01:15:35,874
He's an arsehole...

723
01:15:39,083 --> 01:15:41,665
A bloody scoundrel...

724
01:15:43,958 --> 01:15:47,665
He does the deed...

725
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:51,832
And l pay the price...
Always been so.

726
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:57,540
lf each of your fingers...

727
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:01,290
is worth a crore...

728
01:16:02,541 --> 01:16:05,040
Then five fingers

729
01:16:05,208 --> 01:16:07,415
would be worth how much more?

730
01:16:08,583 --> 01:16:09,832
How much?

731
01:16:11,041 --> 01:16:18,040
Five- Both?
- T... T... Ten...

732
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:21,040
With your ten excuses
you stole my heart away...

733
01:16:21,250 --> 01:16:24,415
Arsehole!

734
01:16:24,583 --> 01:16:25,374
Kiddo!

735
01:16:33,208 --> 01:16:35,290
There is powder worth
ten crores in the guitar.

736
01:16:36,041 --> 01:16:38,374
lf we don't get it back,
we are dead.

737
01:16:39,625 --> 01:16:40,374
And so are you!

738
01:16:40,583 --> 01:16:44,957
That's my br... br... brother...

739
01:16:45,125 --> 01:16:49,040
Cha... Charlie's ph... ph... photo.

740
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:53,165
l'm Gu... Guddu.

741
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:58,124
Here's your burger!

742
01:17:00,125 --> 01:17:03,124
What deal were you talking about?

743
01:17:03,166 --> 01:17:05,332
None of your business!

744
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:07,749
Alright...

745
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:10,124
at least tell me its worth.

746
01:17:11,625 --> 01:17:15,749
l haven't plucked your stuff yet.

747
01:17:18,083 --> 01:17:20,124
How can l sell it?

748
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:22,957
Will this chilli do?

749
01:17:23,083 --> 01:17:24,665
Or should l pluck the real one out?

750
01:17:24,875 --> 01:17:27,124
The phone is working now.

751
01:17:27,666 --> 01:17:29,124
Mikhail... wait outside... l'll join you.

752
01:17:29,166 --> 01:17:30,749
Why are you winking at me?

753
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,040
Why should l leave?

754
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:35,499
They should be the ones leaving.

755
01:17:36,208 --> 01:17:39,082
lt's time you and
your circus troupe left.

756
01:17:39,125 --> 01:17:40,499
Circus troupe?

757
01:17:41,208 --> 01:17:44,290
Or l may have to stuff the chilli.

758
01:17:45,583 --> 01:17:48,707
As in?
- You know what we do...

759
01:17:49,083 --> 01:17:52,499
when a horse refuses to run?

760
01:17:53,083 --> 01:17:54,499
We stuff the chilli up the horse!

761
01:17:55,708 --> 01:17:57,207
How it takes off then

762
01:17:57,416 --> 01:18:01,124
Tik tok tik tok tik tok tik tok.

763
01:18:01,333 --> 01:18:02,499
Later on...

764
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:05,874
to catch up with it...

765
01:18:06,208 --> 01:18:09,040
the jockey sticks two up his own!
- Two?

766
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:17,665
Zip zap zip zap zip zap.

767
01:18:22,166 --> 01:18:26,874
Our way of dealing with...

768
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:30,040
laggards is a little different.

769
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:36,874
We don't try to make them run.

770
01:18:41,625 --> 01:18:42,749
We just blow them off.

771
01:19:24,666 --> 01:19:26,249
Mikhail...

772
01:19:27,625 --> 01:19:31,165
Call him! Your cell...

773
01:19:32,083 --> 01:19:33,124
Call now!

774
01:19:36,583 --> 01:19:39,207
l know he's inside,
please let me meet him.

775
01:19:39,416 --> 01:19:42,040
lt's not allowed.
The interrogation is still on.

776
01:19:42,208 --> 01:19:44,165
Why not?
What's his crime?

777
01:19:44,333 --> 01:19:46,207
We'll drop him home
after the interrogation.

778
01:19:46,416 --> 01:19:48,332
l'll report this to the media!

779
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,457
Remember the Rehman-ur-Rehman case?
- Very well.

780
01:19:51,666 --> 01:19:55,124
The Police Commissioner got transferred!
- Like l care!

781
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:58,374
l'll make sure you lose your job!

782
01:19:58,583 --> 01:20:00,582
Go and do as you wish!

783
01:20:00,791 --> 01:20:02,957
l'm not going anywhere!

784
01:20:04,458 --> 01:20:06,332
Arrest me as well.

785
01:20:07,666 --> 01:20:10,540
Patil!
Send lnspector Manju over here.

786
01:20:10,625 --> 01:20:12,540
Fine, we'll arrest you as well.

787
01:20:13,791 --> 01:20:17,499
My husband is in there,
let me go...

788
01:20:17,708 --> 01:20:20,290
Stop her!
- Guddu... Guddu...

789
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:22,915
l swear l don't have it.
- Where is it?

790
01:20:24,916 --> 01:20:28,290
Don't you understand?
- Please listen...

791
01:20:28,791 --> 01:20:30,915
What is this ruckus?

792
01:20:31,083 --> 01:20:31,999
Prateek, what's going on?

793
01:20:32,166 --> 01:20:34,082
She forced her way in.

794
01:20:35,083 --> 01:20:37,082
l beg you to let him go.

795
01:20:39,916 --> 01:20:41,832
She is his wife...
- Whose wife?

796
01:20:42,041 --> 01:20:43,624
Please leave my foot.
Calm her down!

797
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,290
He is innocent.
- Okay...

798
01:20:52,083 --> 01:20:55,249
Sir, please...
- Alright!

799
01:21:02,166 --> 01:21:05,874
Yes, Charlie is with me.

800
01:21:06,916 --> 01:21:08,249
She's my sister.

801
01:21:09,875 --> 01:21:11,999
Treat her with respect!

802
01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:17,249
Put Shinde on the line...

803
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:03,165
Shinde...

804
01:22:03,833 --> 01:22:04,915
Prateek...

805
01:22:05,375 --> 01:22:07,249
Go and prepare the Nagpal Case report.

806
01:22:07,458 --> 01:22:09,790
But Sir...
- Get going!

807
01:22:19,333 --> 01:22:22,374
We are in a war like situation.

808
01:22:24,375 --> 01:22:27,374
That too,
it's a biological war.

809
01:22:28,458 --> 01:22:30,374
And your brother is
on the enemie's side.

810
01:22:31,625 --> 01:22:34,874
The cocaine belongs to the government,
belongs to us...

811
01:22:35,041 --> 01:22:36,332
and he has stolen that.

812
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:40,332
So sad, isn't it?

813
01:22:41,166 --> 01:22:45,749
Mr Sharma, by this time tomorrow
you'll be in Barabanki.

814
01:22:47,791 --> 01:22:50,624
Mumbai police! Everyone out!
This way please.

815
01:22:50,833 --> 01:22:51,540
Please alight the train.

816
01:22:53,416 --> 01:22:54,874
Please cooperate with us.

817
01:22:55,125 --> 01:22:57,540
Out... everyone.

818
01:22:58,750 --> 01:23:00,874
Ma'am, you too... soon.

819
01:23:04,083 --> 01:23:05,082
Relax...

820
01:23:07,833 --> 01:23:10,207
This is for you.

821
01:23:11,083 --> 01:23:14,165
Now you'll be
free of Bhope's clutches.

822
01:23:14,833 --> 01:23:15,499
Please have a seat.

823
01:23:21,708 --> 01:23:23,290
Finally!

824
01:23:29,041 --> 01:23:30,082
Please eat something!

825
01:23:31,625 --> 01:23:33,290
You haven't eaten a thing.

826
01:23:40,125 --> 01:23:44,249
Don't vent your anger
on this poor burger.

827
01:23:49,083 --> 01:23:51,040
You wouldn't even look at me.

828
01:23:53,666 --> 01:23:54,457
Do you remember?

829
01:23:55,625 --> 01:23:57,957
lf l didn't pretend to stammer...

830
01:23:58,458 --> 01:24:00,249
you wouldn't have spoken to me.

831
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:04,457
Stuck in your own shell...

832
01:24:04,666 --> 01:24:06,249
aloof from the rest of the world.

833
01:24:20,708 --> 01:24:23,207
l left everything behind for you.

834
01:24:24,166 --> 01:24:26,499
And all those things you said to me!

835
01:24:30,041 --> 01:24:31,415
Please forgive me.

836
01:24:37,333 --> 01:24:39,207
lf it weren't for you...

837
01:24:40,125 --> 01:24:44,165
l wouldn't have gone for
the speech therapy.

838
01:24:46,166 --> 01:24:46,790
See

839
01:24:49,041 --> 01:24:50,749
l don't get stuck on S anymore.

840
01:24:55,958 --> 01:24:59,374
l agree l'm a psy... psy...

841
01:25:00,833 --> 01:25:01,374
Psycho!

842
01:25:03,833 --> 01:25:07,999
No, a psycho's husband!

843
01:25:15,208 --> 01:25:17,957
Move it... clear it...

844
01:25:47,708 --> 01:25:48,707
Damn it! Answer the phone!

845
01:25:48,916 --> 01:25:49,707
Where are you?

846
01:25:49,916 --> 01:25:53,082
We talked about five people,
l can see six.

847
01:25:53,125 --> 01:25:56,082
So shoot one down
but where are you?

848
01:25:56,333 --> 01:25:58,207
Behind you.

849
01:26:07,041 --> 01:26:10,915
The exchange will happen
in our compartment...

850
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:12,707
at the next stop.

851
01:26:14,041 --> 01:26:17,290
Where's Charlie?
- Charlie...

852
01:26:42,833 --> 01:26:44,040
Don't do this.

853
01:26:44,708 --> 01:26:48,165
Killing me won't help you.
- And keeping you alive will?

854
01:26:50,208 --> 01:26:54,665
l'll give you one crore rupees.
- That's it?

855
01:26:58,041 --> 01:26:58,832
One and half.

856
01:27:04,166 --> 01:27:06,082
Two... two and half...

857
01:27:06,291 --> 01:27:08,624
You lisping jerk!

858
01:27:10,041 --> 01:27:13,249
Had you told me about
your deal then...

859
01:27:13,458 --> 01:27:14,832
l could've let you go.

860
01:27:15,208 --> 01:27:17,624
Now you can screw yourself.

861
01:27:18,166 --> 01:27:21,207
lf you ever talk to me
like that again...

862
01:27:24,541 --> 01:27:29,207
l'll kill myself. l swear!

863
01:27:32,166 --> 01:27:32,999
Never again!

864
01:27:36,458 --> 01:27:38,790
l swear on our little girl.

865
01:27:40,041 --> 01:27:41,999
Not a girl, a boy!

866
01:27:43,625 --> 01:27:46,165
Girl...
- Boy...

867
01:27:46,375 --> 01:27:47,999
A girl!
- No, a boy!

868
01:27:48,125 --> 01:27:51,374
Rise and shine...

869
01:27:52,625 --> 01:27:55,582
Are we there already?
- Yes, this is your last stop. Come on.

870
01:27:56,625 --> 01:27:58,540
What's the problem?

871
01:28:11,208 --> 01:28:15,124
Five crores... five!

872
01:28:20,875 --> 01:28:21,457
Brother...

873
01:28:22,375 --> 01:28:23,957
Six crores!

874
01:28:24,125 --> 01:28:28,124
l'll be damned!
lt's Thomson and Thompson!

875
01:28:33,666 --> 01:28:35,707
Hey Ram and Shyam?

876
01:28:44,708 --> 01:28:47,082
lf anybody tries to act smart,
l'll shoot her!

877
01:28:51,208 --> 01:28:54,707
Put the gun down.
- Don't shoot her.

878
01:28:55,083 --> 01:28:57,707
Save me.
- Leave my sister!

879
01:28:57,916 --> 01:28:58,540
l'll kill you!

880
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:02,415
Stop the train.
- Pull the chain! Now!

881
01:29:04,916 --> 01:29:08,624
Do as l say.
- l won't spare you!

882
01:29:08,833 --> 01:29:11,874
Pull the bloody chain!

883
01:29:47,041 --> 01:29:48,832
Where is it?

884
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:52,249
Where have you hidden the guitar?

885
01:29:54,208 --> 01:29:55,415
Spit it out!

886
01:30:57,166 --> 01:30:59,749
We are stuck at Panvel
for the last two hours.

887
01:31:00,333 --> 01:31:02,749
lt's been pouring here.

888
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:07,332
l'm not lying, Afghanibhai.

889
01:31:07,791 --> 01:31:11,207
All the roads are blocked!

890
01:31:11,416 --> 01:31:14,749
Tell me when!
- lt's not possible!

891
01:31:15,166 --> 01:31:19,832
lt could take hours.

892
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:21,665
We haven't slept at all.

893
01:31:21,666 --> 01:31:23,249
Shall l sing a lullaby?

894
01:31:23,625 --> 01:31:25,082
Tell me, should l?

895
01:31:27,125 --> 01:31:29,082
Tell him to call
on reaching the jetty.

896
01:31:30,750 --> 01:31:31,499
Listen carefully...

897
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:35,374
call as soon as you reach Mumbai.

898
01:31:52,208 --> 01:31:53,082
One...

899
01:31:56,250 --> 01:31:57,040
two...

900
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:06,665
Three... four... five... six...

901
01:32:06,875 --> 01:32:10,124
seven... eight... nine... ten!

902
01:32:12,583 --> 01:32:15,665
Shoot! Go on shoot!

903
01:32:19,041 --> 01:32:20,290
Can't do it, can you?

904
01:32:21,708 --> 01:32:24,415
Our lives are
trapped in that guitar case.

905
01:32:25,791 --> 01:32:27,249
Once you lay your hands on it...

906
01:32:28,958 --> 01:32:31,624
you'll shoot me without blinking!

907
01:32:34,166 --> 01:32:35,832
Lower your gun and...

908
01:32:37,625 --> 01:32:39,207
call your boss.

909
01:32:42,041 --> 01:32:42,832
Now!

910
01:32:48,041 --> 01:32:52,040
You want to talk to the boss, huh?

911
01:32:55,125 --> 01:32:56,624
The car is stuck,
can you take a look?

912
01:32:57,041 --> 01:33:00,207
Call the boss!
lt's a bloody movie or what!

913
01:33:02,125 --> 01:33:05,124
Come back now... little more.

914
01:33:05,875 --> 01:33:08,582
Move forward now.

915
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:10,790
Accelerate...
- Tell me when.

916
01:33:11,125 --> 01:33:13,999
Put it in reverse now.

917
01:33:14,166 --> 01:33:17,374
Keep going.

918
01:33:20,333 --> 01:33:23,165
What happened?

919
01:33:23,708 --> 01:33:27,999
You're shot!
How did this happen?

920
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:35,582
The car skidded... l didn't see...

921
01:33:36,208 --> 01:33:37,332
l'm sorry...

922
01:33:38,541 --> 01:33:41,540
Let's get you up...
please...

923
01:33:42,625 --> 01:33:45,332
try getting up...

924
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:49,540
No!

925
01:33:57,541 --> 01:33:59,082
Take grandma inside...

926
01:34:05,375 --> 01:34:07,207
and Sweety as well.

927
01:34:11,041 --> 01:34:12,082
No, l won't.

928
01:34:18,375 --> 01:34:19,957
l'll sit right here...

929
01:34:22,541 --> 01:34:24,082
with my husband.

930
01:34:26,166 --> 01:34:27,915
Shameless fool!

931
01:34:29,083 --> 01:34:31,082
Putting me through this hell.

932
01:34:33,291 --> 01:34:35,499
What are you staring at?
Lower your eyes.

933
01:34:38,541 --> 01:34:40,290
ls this your culture?

934
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:45,874
To lure innocent girls
and screw them!

935
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:50,249
When did you arrive here?

936
01:34:53,208 --> 01:34:55,957
Here in Bombay?
- Mumbai!

937
01:34:59,916 --> 01:35:01,665
l was born here.

938
01:35:02,916 --> 01:35:05,457
But father arrived in B...

939
01:35:06,625 --> 01:35:10,040
Bombay in 1984.
- Mumbai!

940
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:14,874
lt was called Bombay back then.

941
01:35:21,125 --> 01:35:25,040
Bastard! lt was Mumbai then
and it is Mumbai now!

942
01:35:26,583 --> 01:35:28,207
You bloody migrants...

943
01:35:30,208 --> 01:35:33,207
are chewing the city
hollow like termites!

944
01:35:34,458 --> 01:35:36,207
The city is bursting at it's seams...

945
01:35:36,416 --> 01:35:38,832
and you people swarm in like flies!

946
01:35:39,250 --> 01:35:40,832
To rob our share of the pie.

947
01:35:42,333 --> 01:35:45,207
My father used to say that...

948
01:35:46,208 --> 01:35:49,374
we are like sugar added to milk.

949
01:35:50,875 --> 01:35:54,415
lf we leave,
the milk won't lessen but...

950
01:35:57,416 --> 01:35:58,999
will turn bland.

951
01:35:59,666 --> 01:36:02,707
How thoughtful!
The chief has diabetes.

952
01:36:02,916 --> 01:36:04,707
What do we do with him?

953
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:07,707
Listen...

954
01:36:10,041 --> 01:36:13,999
l understand your love for each other.

955
01:36:15,250 --> 01:36:16,707
l got a vibe in the train.

956
01:36:18,083 --> 01:36:20,707
But if my sister marries a migrant...

957
01:36:21,875 --> 01:36:23,540
l'll be crucified!

958
01:36:25,125 --> 01:36:28,124
My grave will be dug.

959
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:32,540
Not only will l lose my reputation...

960
01:36:33,041 --> 01:36:34,540
but my election fund as well.

961
01:36:35,458 --> 01:36:39,790
The builder is paying me to
get his son and Sweety married.

962
01:36:40,333 --> 01:36:41,749
Five crores!

963
01:36:42,916 --> 01:36:46,124
Can you imagine how much that is?

964
01:36:49,083 --> 01:36:51,457
There is powder worth
ten crores in the guitar.

965
01:36:56,708 --> 01:36:57,707
How much?

966
01:36:58,875 --> 01:37:00,707
Five whopping crores!

967
01:37:02,291 --> 01:37:04,499
lf l give you ten...

968
01:37:05,833 --> 01:37:06,915
will you sell her to me?

969
01:37:14,041 --> 01:37:15,124
Ten crores!

970
01:37:18,083 --> 01:37:19,832
l can take it all if l want.

971
01:37:21,041 --> 01:37:25,082
But all l want is ten lakhs.

972
01:37:27,458 --> 01:37:28,749
What is your name?

973
01:37:30,666 --> 01:37:33,040
Anything you want to call me!

974
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:35,249
Do you know who l am?

975
01:37:36,083 --> 01:37:39,457
No... but l know you're badly screwed!

976
01:37:41,083 --> 01:37:44,665
You don't have a choice.

977
01:37:45,916 --> 01:37:48,040
l'll dig you out from your grave.

978
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:00,249
Have mercy!
You can have it all!

979
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:01,999
Shut the crap!

980
01:38:17,416 --> 01:38:21,832
Useless dolts!
As soon as l'm away...

981
01:38:22,208 --> 01:38:23,624
you guys start jerking off!

982
01:38:26,208 --> 01:38:27,165
Tell me!

983
01:38:27,208 --> 01:38:27,999
Chief, we were...

984
01:38:28,166 --> 01:38:31,207
Chief, "chief"...
stop barking!

985
01:38:34,208 --> 01:38:37,874
Grandma has given the nod!

986
01:38:39,208 --> 01:38:41,624
Brother-in-law, can you believe it?

987
01:38:41,708 --> 01:38:45,249
lt wasn't easy getting her around.

988
01:38:45,708 --> 01:38:47,415
She can be quite fickle...

989
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,374
so we've got to act quickly!

990
01:38:50,458 --> 01:38:51,665
Go get the guitar!

991
01:38:51,875 --> 01:38:53,332
We'll take care of the wedding.

992
01:38:53,541 --> 01:38:56,165
Start the arrangements right away...

993
01:38:56,375 --> 01:38:58,249
contact the caterer...

994
01:38:58,458 --> 01:39:01,165
and go tell grandma
to make sweets.

995
01:39:01,208 --> 01:39:04,165
We're having a feast tonight.

996
01:39:05,541 --> 01:39:08,165
Why haven't you left?

997
01:39:10,041 --> 01:39:13,540
You should get going...

998
01:39:15,125 --> 01:39:18,124
What about the election now?

999
01:39:19,291 --> 01:39:20,457
What about it?

1000
01:39:21,250 --> 01:39:24,124
l'll join the party that backs your lot.

1001
01:39:24,333 --> 01:39:25,540
Brother-in-law...

1002
01:39:27,125 --> 01:39:31,124
politics is a business.

1003
01:39:32,083 --> 01:39:36,749
Power and family.
That's all that matters!

1004
01:39:47,708 --> 01:39:50,207
Done digging my grave?

1005
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:52,290
Reporting from inside the coffin.

1006
01:39:54,416 --> 01:39:58,290
You got your ten lakhs.

1007
01:40:00,083 --> 01:40:02,707
Deal. Take down the address.

1008
01:40:03,375 --> 01:40:05,707
l've sent the address and plan.

1009
01:40:06,166 --> 01:40:07,290
With whom?

1010
01:40:08,041 --> 01:40:08,915
Police.

1011
01:40:10,541 --> 01:40:11,707
Should be on their way.

1012
01:40:46,958 --> 01:40:48,665
Look at that!
Chief Tope...

1013
01:40:50,750 --> 01:40:53,040
sleeping like a baby!

1014
01:40:57,375 --> 01:41:00,415
Let's find the guitar.

1015
01:42:00,125 --> 01:42:02,540
Daddy...

1016
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:18,540
Found the guitar?
- Still searching.

1017
01:42:19,333 --> 01:42:23,957
Beware! The lisper is with the cops!

1018
01:42:24,125 --> 01:42:26,665
They'll come around sniffing.
- Alright.

1019
01:42:29,041 --> 01:42:34,707
As soon as you find the stuff
shoot him off.- Sure.

1020
01:42:36,541 --> 01:42:37,665
What if we don't find it?

1021
01:42:38,250 --> 01:42:40,124
Then get your mom hooked up with him!

1022
01:42:40,333 --> 01:42:43,082
Why drag my poor mom into this?

1023
01:42:44,166 --> 01:42:46,249
Hail Maharashtra!
- Hail Maharashtra!

1024
01:42:46,458 --> 01:42:47,915
Hail Maharashtra!

1025
01:42:49,458 --> 01:42:50,290
What are you doing here?

1026
01:42:51,875 --> 01:42:52,915
Listening.

1027
01:42:53,708 --> 01:42:54,290
Listening to what?

1028
01:43:01,208 --> 01:43:05,249
How about a chocolate?
- No, l want a car!

1029
01:43:07,083 --> 01:43:11,249
My god! A car?

1030
01:43:12,375 --> 01:43:14,249
Keep this!

1031
01:43:14,666 --> 01:43:18,665
This won't even get me a bicycle.

1032
01:43:23,291 --> 01:43:24,665
ls this good enough?

1033
01:43:25,541 --> 01:43:31,040
Remember, you heard nothing!
Now scram!

1034
01:43:45,625 --> 01:43:46,415
You shitface!

1035
01:43:48,250 --> 01:43:49,582
You aren't dead yet?

1036
01:43:55,458 --> 01:43:59,207
Now what do you want?
- You're alright?

1037
01:43:59,750 --> 01:44:03,040
The police let you go?

1038
01:44:03,208 --> 01:44:07,415
Disappointed to see me alive?

1039
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:09,999
Arsehole!

1040
01:44:11,625 --> 01:44:14,165
You almost sacrificed me for the girl.

1041
01:44:27,791 --> 01:44:30,374
We got married last night.

1042
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:37,165
Now you want a wedding gift?

1043
01:44:40,875 --> 01:44:41,999
l need a loan.

1044
01:44:43,291 --> 01:44:45,124
Did the sun rise from the west today?

1045
01:44:48,875 --> 01:44:50,540
Will my filthy money be...

1046
01:44:53,166 --> 01:44:54,165
good for you?

1047
01:45:00,083 --> 01:45:01,124
l don't want money...

1048
01:45:04,250 --> 01:45:05,540
l want the guitar case.

1049
01:45:08,375 --> 01:45:09,332
Come again?

1050
01:45:18,875 --> 01:45:20,915
l'll gouge your eyes out,
if you even look at it.

1051
01:45:22,166 --> 01:45:25,915
Sweety's life depends on it.
- How sweet!

1052
01:45:26,916 --> 01:45:30,082
She's pregnant.
- l'm not responsible.

1053
01:45:31,416 --> 01:45:34,915
l will repay every penny.

1054
01:45:35,541 --> 01:45:39,207
Wasn't l d... dead for you?

1055
01:45:40,708 --> 01:45:41,915
Arsehole!

1056
01:45:42,125 --> 01:45:44,165
Remember, what you
swore on dad's pyre?

1057
01:45:45,208 --> 01:45:48,290
l don't want to see
your f... f... face ever again.

1058
01:45:48,333 --> 01:45:51,499
Stop blaming yourself!

1059
01:45:57,125 --> 01:45:58,790
Bury the ghosts of the past.

1060
01:46:01,083 --> 01:46:02,374
Forgive yourself.

1061
01:46:07,041 --> 01:46:08,249
Whose ghosts?

1062
01:46:09,166 --> 01:46:10,249
Forgive myself for what?

1063
01:46:11,166 --> 01:46:13,874
Even if you
got the money on time...

1064
01:46:14,333 --> 01:46:16,249
dad would've killed himself.

1065
01:46:17,750 --> 01:46:22,415
Neither of us are responsible
for his death.

1066
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:27,624
But we are responsible
for our own lives.

1067
01:46:38,125 --> 01:46:41,832
Let me go or it'll be too late.

1068
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:32,665
Guddu!

1069
01:47:42,625 --> 01:47:44,332
Life is offering you a second chance.

1070
01:47:48,208 --> 01:47:51,124
Don't walk away from the right path.

1071
01:47:52,208 --> 01:47:53,749
l swear l'll shoot.

1072
01:48:28,291 --> 01:48:29,707
There was a time...

1073
01:48:31,250 --> 01:48:35,290
when we were inseparable.

1074
01:48:38,708 --> 01:48:40,249
Daddy...

1075
01:48:46,958 --> 01:48:49,749
We were so happy.

1076
01:48:50,708 --> 01:48:53,874
He was both
a mother and father to us.

1077
01:48:55,791 --> 01:48:57,249
He was our hero.

1078
01:48:59,541 --> 01:49:00,874
A thief, he wasn't.

1079
01:49:02,291 --> 01:49:05,665
What made him steal the watch...
and for whom...

1080
01:49:06,125 --> 01:49:08,582
was beyond our understanding.

1081
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,415
Five thousand, nothing less.

1082
01:49:21,625 --> 01:49:24,165
l've spoken with the boss.
Go get it.

1083
01:49:24,375 --> 01:49:26,040
We'll let your father go.

1084
01:49:31,791 --> 01:49:35,624
They've asked for five, l have three.

1085
01:49:35,875 --> 01:49:38,207
How?
- Scholarship...

1086
01:49:38,791 --> 01:49:40,624
Where is it?
- The wa... wa...

1087
01:49:40,791 --> 01:49:42,124
The watch tower?
- Yes.

1088
01:49:42,166 --> 01:49:46,165
Stay with father,
l'll be back with five.

1089
01:50:25,416 --> 01:50:27,957
By the time
l returned with the money...

1090
01:50:28,875 --> 01:50:32,457
father had committed suicide.

1091
01:50:39,208 --> 01:50:41,249
And with his death...

1092
01:50:42,666 --> 01:50:46,332
we were brothers no more.

1093
01:50:47,958 --> 01:50:52,082
Open your mouth... ha.. ha.. ha..!

1094
01:50:55,250 --> 01:50:57,915
Daddy...

1095
01:51:45,625 --> 01:51:48,040
This is the voicemail box of lnspector Lele.

1096
01:51:48,083 --> 01:51:49,665
Leave a message after the beep.

1097
01:51:49,875 --> 01:51:51,665
Hail Maharashtra, Hail lndia!

1098
01:51:53,166 --> 01:51:55,082
Mr Charlie...
This is lnspector Lele...

1099
01:51:55,125 --> 01:51:57,415
We've arranged for your ten lakhs.

1100
01:51:57,583 --> 01:52:01,207
Sir, where do we meet?

1101
01:52:01,416 --> 01:52:04,415
Sir, please call back when free.

1102
01:52:12,708 --> 01:52:14,415
Now can you call for a doctor?

1103
01:52:16,708 --> 01:52:20,415
He'll bleed to death.
- Kiddo...

1104
01:52:22,458 --> 01:52:24,832
Try again.
- Sir?

1105
01:52:25,625 --> 01:52:26,832
Call!

1106
01:52:32,833 --> 01:52:34,582
And if he doesn't answer...

1107
01:52:35,958 --> 01:52:37,582
shoot yourself!

1108
01:52:54,125 --> 01:52:55,374
Kiddo...

1109
01:52:55,958 --> 01:52:57,790
We're screwed!
For real!

1110
01:53:00,666 --> 01:53:03,332
Enough is enough!
- What do you mean?

1111
01:53:03,666 --> 01:53:06,332
lf you want you can call me,
when the stuff comes.

1112
01:53:06,791 --> 01:53:08,332
l'll be in lndia somewhere.

1113
01:53:09,791 --> 01:53:13,540
Tashi has everything under control.
You've got to trust me on this.

1114
01:53:13,750 --> 01:53:17,124
He is messing with us.
Can't you see?

1115
01:53:19,541 --> 01:53:24,957
Cajetan, if you walk through that door,
l'll shoot you.

1116
01:53:25,250 --> 01:53:27,707
This is the voicemail box of lnspector Lele.

1117
01:53:27,916 --> 01:53:29,165
Leave a message after the beep.

1118
01:53:29,375 --> 01:53:31,124
Hail Maharashtra, Hail lndia!

1119
01:53:38,708 --> 01:53:39,499
Please...

1120
01:54:01,250 --> 01:54:07,915
l have given my blood for the diamonds.
Get it?

1121
01:54:19,083 --> 01:54:21,707
Forgive me, brother.

1122
01:54:27,666 --> 01:54:30,249
Now do l get another chance?

1123
01:54:45,666 --> 01:54:48,207
The department suspects these two...

1124
01:54:48,250 --> 01:54:51,624
are working for the underworld.

1125
01:55:07,125 --> 01:55:10,207
What can Life do
Now that l have fallen into its lot

1126
01:55:10,666 --> 01:55:13,207
l have sapped its spirit
Gnawed at its flesh

1127
01:55:14,208 --> 01:55:17,165
With my incessant complaints

1128
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:23,999
Day in and day out

1129
01:55:24,208 --> 01:55:31,790
My desires are mean

1130
01:55:34,625 --> 01:55:42,165
Mean are my dreams too

1131
01:55:45,250 --> 01:55:51,540
A little rapport
l had struck with the heart

1132
01:55:52,125 --> 01:55:57,124
That monsieur too
turned out to be mean

1133
01:55:59,583 --> 01:56:02,999
What can Life do
Now that l have fallen into its lot

1134
01:56:03,166 --> 01:56:06,540
l have sapped its spirit
Gnawed at its flesh

1135
01:56:06,750 --> 01:56:10,124
With my incessant complaints

1136
01:56:10,333 --> 01:56:15,332
Day in and day out

1137
01:56:20,041 --> 01:56:22,582
Sweety, have you lost it!

1138
01:56:23,250 --> 01:56:24,707
Guddu must be on his way back

1139
01:56:25,250 --> 01:56:26,915
put the gun down.

1140
01:56:27,083 --> 01:56:29,499
You're a swine!

1141
01:56:30,041 --> 01:56:32,082
l know what you told
Ganesh over the phone.

1142
01:56:37,041 --> 01:56:40,874
You're misunderstanding me.
l swear!

1143
01:56:41,208 --> 01:56:42,082
Go on...

1144
01:56:42,458 --> 01:56:43,499
go get her!

1145
01:56:48,875 --> 01:56:51,707
We'll be able to hear each other.

1146
01:56:52,083 --> 01:56:55,249
Don't do anything,
until l instruct you.

1147
01:56:56,500 --> 01:56:57,249
Remember...

1148
01:56:58,083 --> 01:57:00,457
we have to catch Bhope red handed.

1149
01:57:00,666 --> 01:57:01,915
Wear this.

1150
01:57:04,125 --> 01:57:05,707
l'll kill you...
- Me? You'll kill me?

1151
01:57:05,916 --> 01:57:08,040
Go ahead!

1152
01:57:11,083 --> 01:57:17,040
You were this little
when mother passed away.

1153
01:57:17,583 --> 01:57:20,040
Just like a small kitten.

1154
01:57:21,125 --> 01:57:24,165
Shoot me and then you can leave.

1155
01:57:24,208 --> 01:57:25,582
Let's see what you've got.

1156
01:57:36,208 --> 01:57:42,415
Guddu... - Now go... go on...

1157
01:57:43,625 --> 01:57:45,207
So...

1158
01:57:46,291 --> 01:57:47,790
should l blow up his skull?

1159
01:57:48,041 --> 01:57:51,040
Lower the gun!

1160
01:58:01,458 --> 01:58:03,874
Sunil Shekhar Bhope.

1161
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:08,165
Bhope...

1162
01:58:13,125 --> 01:58:15,165
Afghani, stay with the Africans.

1163
01:58:17,250 --> 01:58:20,040
Grandpa! Where is Bhope?

1164
01:58:20,250 --> 01:58:24,582
He's in the courtyard.
Screwed... big time!

1165
01:58:27,166 --> 01:58:28,999
Lower the gun... please!

1166
01:58:29,208 --> 01:58:31,374
Why don't you tell her
to lower the gun?

1167
01:58:31,583 --> 01:58:33,040
Let me be.
- He's saying...

1168
01:58:33,250 --> 01:58:35,124
G... gun... lower the gun.

1169
01:58:35,333 --> 01:58:37,957
Hand over the guitar, quickly!

1170
01:58:38,125 --> 01:58:40,249
The stuff...
- Screw the stuff!

1171
01:58:40,291 --> 01:58:42,957
Talk some sense into her!

1172
01:58:43,583 --> 01:58:45,332
Lower the g... gun...

1173
01:58:45,541 --> 01:58:46,999
l'm absolutely fine.

1174
01:58:47,166 --> 01:58:48,332
Bhope...

1175
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:55,957
You'll shoot me?

1176
01:59:06,541 --> 01:59:09,290
You actually shot me?

1177
01:59:09,875 --> 01:59:10,915
How dare you?

1178
01:59:11,083 --> 01:59:12,915
Get lost!

1179
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:25,499
chief... here...

1180
01:59:27,166 --> 01:59:28,040
chief

1181
01:59:41,041 --> 01:59:44,249
Relax, Bhope... take it easy.

1182
01:59:46,541 --> 01:59:47,665
Who the hell are you?

1183
01:59:48,916 --> 01:59:52,249
Even we've got guns.

1184
01:59:53,083 --> 01:59:54,040
Big ones!

1185
01:59:54,875 --> 01:59:56,874
But who wants a war?

1186
01:59:58,125 --> 01:59:59,207
l'm not America.

1187
01:59:59,416 --> 02:00:02,249
This is Maharashtra!

1188
02:00:04,791 --> 02:00:07,457
Who the hell are you?
- Me? l'm Tashi.

1189
02:00:07,875 --> 02:00:09,249
Tashi, the Great!

1190
02:00:26,708 --> 02:00:28,665
l don't believe this!
You're alive.

1191
02:00:31,416 --> 02:00:35,040
move the guitar. Move it!

1192
02:00:42,208 --> 02:00:45,582
Tashi! A tiger in a mousetrap!

1193
02:00:45,791 --> 02:00:48,915
Call headquarters for reinforcements.
- Copy Sir.

1194
02:00:49,250 --> 02:00:53,915
Headquarter come in,
this is Tigerhead.

1195
02:00:54,083 --> 02:00:57,082
Team One is moving in.
We need back-up.

1196
02:00:59,166 --> 02:01:01,457
Guddu, we're coming in, don't panic.

1197
02:01:01,666 --> 02:01:02,790
lt's going to be okay.

1198
02:01:15,166 --> 02:01:16,999
Granted you have the stuff.

1199
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:22,749
How do you plan to sell it and to whom?

1200
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,749
Ultimately the guitar
will come back to me!

1201
02:01:29,541 --> 02:01:34,332
How much for your charity fund?

1202
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,415
Ten crores! Cash!

1203
02:01:49,541 --> 02:01:50,832
ln Dollars or Euros?

1204
02:01:56,916 --> 02:01:59,082
You freaking dirty rat!

1205
02:01:59,541 --> 02:02:04,415
This is the Anti-Narcotics Cell
of the Mumbai police!

1206
02:02:04,625 --> 02:02:06,082
Surrender your guns!

1207
02:02:06,125 --> 02:02:08,290
This is the Anti-Narcotics Cell
of the Mumbai police!

1208
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:09,999
Surrender your guns!

1209
02:02:10,166 --> 02:02:12,790
Don't move or l'll shoot!

1210
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:16,040
l'll kill your spy.

1211
02:02:16,083 --> 02:02:18,707
lf he is hurt,
nobody will be spared.

1212
02:02:18,916 --> 02:02:19,707
Surrender yourselves!

1213
02:02:30,916 --> 02:02:32,665
You have no option.
There is an option.

1214
02:02:32,875 --> 02:02:38,665
Hey Pele...
Tell him your plan!

1215
02:02:38,708 --> 02:02:44,457
l'm Lele, not Pele!
- Whatever!

1216
02:02:45,041 --> 02:02:48,874
Tell the lnspector, he gets 33% .

1217
02:02:51,166 --> 02:02:53,790
Prateek... it's me lnspector Lele.

1218
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,415
What you doing up there?
Come down.

1219
02:02:56,625 --> 02:02:57,874
The stuff is worth ten crores.

1220
02:02:58,041 --> 02:03:01,124
3,33,33,333.33... all ours!

1221
02:03:01,166 --> 02:03:03,415
All yours!
- And there's no Lobo to share it with.

1222
02:03:03,625 --> 02:03:05,457
Come down.

1223
02:03:05,666 --> 02:03:06,624
Hold your fire.

1224
02:03:12,750 --> 02:03:16,249
What the hell is this?
- Shut up, Cajetan!

1225
02:03:16,291 --> 02:03:17,624
Tashi, he is right!

1226
02:03:17,833 --> 02:03:20,165
Shut the hell up... shut up!

1227
02:03:20,375 --> 02:03:24,540
Last and final,
60, 20, 20.

1228
02:03:24,750 --> 02:03:27,040
Or you can shoot!
- Shoot?

1229
02:03:27,208 --> 02:03:29,832
Go on shoot!

1230
02:03:30,458 --> 02:03:32,832
Shoot and l'll burn the stuff!

1231
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,165
Hold your fire!

1232
02:03:37,041 --> 02:03:39,207
Charlie boy... great job!

1233
02:03:39,250 --> 02:03:40,999
Fourth partner!

1234
02:03:41,166 --> 02:03:44,582
25% each!

1235
02:03:44,958 --> 02:03:47,207
Now come down.

1236
02:03:47,416 --> 02:03:48,999
Hey... knucklehead!

1237
02:03:49,958 --> 02:03:52,540
l didn't risk it all
for the money.

1238
02:03:53,125 --> 02:03:56,374
l did it for this stupid Romeo!

1239
02:03:57,625 --> 02:04:00,040
He doesn't know this world is a bitch

1240
02:04:00,208 --> 02:04:02,624
and how rotten you dogs really are!

1241
02:04:02,833 --> 02:04:03,790
Let him go!

1242
02:04:04,166 --> 02:04:06,165
Her as well.

1243
02:04:09,166 --> 02:04:11,540
Take your Juliet along and run!

1244
02:04:11,750 --> 02:04:12,957
And you?

1245
02:04:13,083 --> 02:04:16,957
You'll kill me
with all your love!

1246
02:04:18,083 --> 02:04:18,749
Get moving!

1247
02:04:20,333 --> 02:04:23,207
At least for the baby's sake.

1248
02:04:23,625 --> 02:04:24,540
Guddu, move it!

1249
02:04:25,541 --> 02:04:32,749
Come down with the guitar!

1250
02:04:32,916 --> 02:04:34,540
Drop your gun!

1251
02:05:34,041 --> 02:05:37,457
This path that you bargained for

1252
02:05:38,125 --> 02:05:40,249
Will stay deserted

1253
02:05:48,291 --> 02:05:52,082
The noose of life

1254
02:05:52,416 --> 02:05:54,415
Does never snap

1255
02:06:19,875 --> 02:06:28,582
Who walk the edge of swords
will unfailingly get hurt

1256
02:06:30,125 --> 02:06:36,999
The noose snared around your neck
only tightens, does not snap

1257
02:06:38,125 --> 02:06:39,957
The color of blood

1258
02:06:40,125 --> 02:06:41,790
However sanguine

1259
02:06:42,166 --> 02:06:44,582
Fails to color life

1260
02:06:52,416 --> 02:06:56,374
The noose of life

1261
02:06:56,583 --> 02:06:59,957
Does never snap

1262
02:07:34,750 --> 02:07:36,082
Hail Maharashtra!

1263
02:07:44,416 --> 02:07:54,082
The sliver of time between
two breaths is too fine

1264
02:07:54,625 --> 02:07:59,082
Life is offering you
a second chance.

1265
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:03,582
Don't walk away
from the right path.

1266
02:08:03,791 --> 02:08:09,040
My past sneaks into the future
and robs it off all hope

1267
02:08:15,666 --> 02:08:25,457
Rivers of blood
never find themselves an ocean

1268
02:09:05,333 --> 02:09:08,374
l told you, didn't l?
You'd have twins!

1269
02:09:12,250 --> 02:09:14,790
lf you bet against me,
you'll always lose.

1270
02:09:15,833 --> 02:09:17,165
Now tell me...

1271
02:09:18,250 --> 02:09:19,582
whom do they look like?

1272
02:09:22,916 --> 02:09:24,124
How sweet!

1273
02:09:36,208 --> 02:09:37,999
